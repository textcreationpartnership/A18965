         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing collected and finiſhed this Treatiſe enſuing, and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing verie carefully with my ſelfe to whom I might dedicate the ſame: at length I reſolued, that none were meeter to vndertake the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage thereof, then ſome ſuch meeteſt perſons, as did alreadie, (in ſome good meaſure) practiſe within their ſeuerall Charges, the ſeuerall poynts and duties contained therein, and ſo would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecute thoſe other neceſſarie parts, which
<pb facs="tcp:8506:3"/> they haue yet in ſome part pretermitted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, calling to minde the holy exerciſes daylie vſed and exerciſed in all your houſes: I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for two cauſes, to make you all ioyntly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones hereof. Firſt, for that I acknowledge my ſelfe beholden and indebted vnto you all diuerſly, ſince my firſt acquaintance with you, &amp; therefore (leaſt I ſhould deſerue the blame of vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for benefits receiued) I am bold vnder your names, to offer to the whole Church of God, theſe my ſimple collections. Secondly, for that as you are all ioyned and linked in kindred by reaſon of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: ſo alſo you are, and haue beene a long time inſeperably knit in a zealous &amp; ſincere profeſſion of Gods word and religion. And for ſo much as I may not (for many reſpects) accompliſh what good I willingly would: yet leaſt I ſhould be thought to ſpend the remainder of my yeres in an idle condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to hide my tallent in a napkin: I haue been no leſſe careful, then willing, to labour otherwaies to doo what I may to glorifie God, and profit his Church. Neither will theſe my labours be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnprofitable, if my purpoſe therein be rightly conferred with the purport of my writings. For ſuch Houſeholders, as pretend to be great prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and ſound profeſſors of the Goſpell, may long inough talke of diſcipline, and ſtil complaine of the want of Church-gouernment, but all in vaine, and to no purpoſe, vnleſſe they will begin this most neceſſary diſcipline in reforming their
<pb facs="tcp:8506:3"/> own houſes, according to the direction handled in this Treatiſe, and ſo to ſuffer the holy religion of God, to take place amongſt their families at home, otherwiſe they ſhall trauell much, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit little. For although there bee neuer ſo good lawes in Cities: neuer ſo pure order in Churches, yet if maiſters of families, do not practiſe at home catechiſing, and diſcipline in their houſes, and ioyne their helping hands to Magiſtrates, and Ministers: they may in trueth, (but vniustly, as many haue done) complaine that their children and ſeruants are diſordered, and corrupted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, when in trueth, they were diſordered, and are ſtill corrupted, and mard at home. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be, neither is it to be hoped for, that either the father of his children, or the huſband of his wife, or the maister of his ſeruants ſhould looke for that obedience, that reuerence, that faithfulneſſe, and that dutifulneſſe, which they of right ought to haue, and the other in conſcience, and of bounden dutie are bound to performe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they do now at length endeuour to ſee theſe orders and duties hereafter mentioned, to bee practiſed within their ſeueral Houſeholds. For if Parents and Houſeholders ſhal performe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dutie to their children and ſeruants, then to prouide for them, meat, drinke, and apparell, and to pay them their wages: then Papists, Atheiſts, yea, Turkes, and Infidels, do yeelde this dutie as well as they. And ſeeing all men be carefull, that
<pb facs="tcp:8506:4"/> their horſes and bullocks, ſhould haue ſufficient fodder and prouender, to the end they may haue their labour in lieu and recompence thereof, it doth conſequently follow, that therefore a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Houſeholder ought to haue ouer his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeruants, a much more chriſtian care, then he hath ouer his dumbe &amp; inſenſible beaſts, that ſo he may take a ſingular comfort from the daylie contemplation of their encreaſe in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces. Oh what a ſweete and comfortable thing ſhall this be to the ſoule and conſcience of ſuch an Houſeholder, as when he hath been ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and carefull in the trayning and bringing vp of his children and ſeruants, in the obedience and waies of the Lorde, that hee may rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to haue this worthie report &amp; commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion giuen vnto him, from the mouth and penne of the godly: namely, that he hath a church in his houſe: that is, a company of ſound and faithfull Chriſtians, ſuch as feare God indeed: As the like report was giuen by the Apoſtle, to thoſe godly Houſe-keepers, <hi>Aquilla,</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> his wife: <hi>Rom. 16.5. 1. Cor. 16.19.</hi> As alſo to <hi>Philemon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note>Therefore all Parents and Houſeholders, are (in the Lorde) to be exhorted, that they would be carefull to bring vp their children and familie, ſo as they either (by ſome good tokens) may ſee them the children of God, and heires of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or at leaſt, they may be comforted in their owne conſciences, notwithſtanding their children
<pb facs="tcp:8506:4"/> and ſeruants (for ſome cauſe vnknowne to them) do refuſe their counſell and inſtruction, ſeeing they to the vttermoſt of their power and abilitie, haue vſed all good meanes to bring them vp well, and haue rightly offered them to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now if parents and maiſters haue iuſt cauſe to bewaile and lament, when (thus trauelling in good education and information) they cannot yet ſee good effects, and godly fruites, in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp; ſeruants: how much more cauſe of griefe may they haue, when they haue vſed and beſtowed no labor at all (either by themſelues, or others for them) to bring them vp in the nurture and feare of the Lord? And yet, alaſſe, many will be grieued for the one, that will not be any thing mooued for the other. Wherefore let all parents and maisters of families know, and learne, that if they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay God his bleſſings to their poſterities, then they muſt do, and performe the duties belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: yea let them (if they be loth to conuey God his iudgements to their children) carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the meanes vnto it.</p>
            <p>And ſurely,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> as it is a bleſſed thing in the houre of death, with <hi>Simeon</hi> to depart in peace, leauing their wiues, children and ſeruants, members of Chriſt, ſpouſes to Chriſt, children to God, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to the Lord: ſo in the extremitie of death, no one thing wil bee more greeuous vnto Parents and Houſeholders, then (the Lord hauing giuen them the charge of ſo many ſoules to be furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:8506:5"/> to ſaluation) that their own tormented co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſhall preſſe them, who in as much as they could haue helped their children and ſeruants forward to their damnation, &amp; ſo (which is more fearefull) they ſhall haue them ſpewing and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out on their faces, continuall curſes in hell, accuſing them for euer to be murtherers of their ſoules, and cut throats of their ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Is it any maruell, if Houſeholders many times finde ſmall obedience, and leſſe dutifulneſſe, and faithfulneſſe, at the hands of their children and ſeruants, ſeeing they omit and leaue vndone the performance of theſe ſo chriſtian duties towards them herein expreſſed, and inioyned of the Lord? For ſo doth God often leaue manifeſt tokens of his wrath, in puniſhing diſobedience, with diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>How can any maiſter of a Houſehold, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he bee, looke to haue his familie truſtie and faithfull vnto him, and yet he himſelfe is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to God? Doth he maruell, that his children and ſeruants feare not him, whereas hee himſelfe feareth not the Lord? Will he maintaine his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer thoſe vnder his charge, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth not yeelde obedience vnto the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God his Creator?</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it is manifeſt, that the goodman of the houſe, by planting Gods religion in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſhall not a little aduance and ſet forward his owne priuat profit and commoditie. For wicked
<pb facs="tcp:8506:5"/> and vngodly ſeruants, are, for the moſt part, loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers pickers, and deceitfull: whereas on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, godly ſeruants are iuſt and faythfull, whom in his abſence he may truſt to doo ſuch buſineſſe and worke as hee willeth them to doo.<note place="margin">Gen. 30.30. and 39.5. &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If maiſters of families be carefull and deſirous (as in conſcience they ought) that their wiues, children &amp; ſeruants, ſhould reforme themſelues, and endeuour to practiſe ſuch duties as do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and belong vnto them, then they muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be diligent and carefull to reforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, both inwardly &amp; outwardly, in ſuch poynts and duties, as hitherto they haue left vndone: otherwiſe, they may iuſtly ſay vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Phiſitian,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.23. and 22.32.

            <p>But the Wiſedome that wee ſpeake of is not naturall, but fetched from the fountaine of all wiſedome,<note place="margin">But learned out of the word.</note> GOD himſelfe, who by his word ſhineth vnto vs pure light to walke by, not in the Church alone, nor in the publike ſocietie of men onely, but euen within the ſecret of our owne walles, and toward ſuch as be abiding vnder the ſame roofe.

If maiſters then or parents doo not gouerne, but let ſeruants and children do as they liſt, they do not onely diſobey God, and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage themſelues, but alſo hurt thoſe whome they ſhould rule: for when any haue ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to do as they liſt, it maketh them grow out of order, to the prouoking of Gods diſpleaſure, and curſe againſt themſelues, whereas if they had been helde in by the brydle of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they might bee brought to walke, ſo as the bleſſing of God ſhould follow them in their courſes.</p>

               <hi>I and mine houſe will ſerue the Lord,</hi> promiſing not onely for himſelfe, but for all his, which though it was too hard to do, yet becauſe he knew how many meanes the Lord had giuen him to bring it to paſſe, which alſo God would bleſſe (as all godly exhortations, admonitions, and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby if they did not profite, he had authoritie to thruſt them out of his houſe, and to rid himſelfe of them) all which hee was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to put in practiſe: therefore he was bold thus to ſpeake of himſelfe, thereby ſhewing what all men ſhould propound to themſelues, and may attaine vnto.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8506:14"/> to reward them: and to them that were bad, to puniſh them, that ſo not onely himſelfe, but all his, might ſerue the Lord.

            <p>Now this is that, to wit, that the Sabboth, and the day of Faſt, are both of one nature, and it is that which the word doth ſufficiently beare witneſſe vnto: therefore if this hath beene the practiſe of the Church, vpon that day to faſt, not onely of the chiefe alone, but with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: then muſt we needes be perſwaded, that vpon the Lordes day, we ought our ſelues, and our houſholds to ſerue the Lord, &amp; to ſay with <hi>Ioſua, I and mine houſe will ſerue the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>So then by all this, it may moſt euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, both by the words of the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the practiſe of the beſt men in the olde and newe Teſtament, that this dutie is laid vpon all houſeholders, diligently to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the wayes of their families, that they ſerue God, as in all other dueties, ſo eſpecially in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the Sabboth, as they will anſwere to the contrary at their perill, to him that hath put

            <p>This dutie then belongeth to a chriſtian head of a familie, to worſhip God with all his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, &amp; to take order, that when he ſhalbe abſent, vpon neceſſary occaſion, it may be done reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and duly, by ſome one in his familie, that by reaſon of wit and age, may be meet for it.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, that they may not onely know, and profeſſe religion, but alſo feele and ſhew the power of religion in their liues. This dutie hath theſe ſpecials belonging to it: Firſt, a familiar &amp; plaine opening vnto them, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion, after the manner of a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme. This dutie the holy Ghoſt layeth vpon parents. Ephe. 6.4. <hi>Traine them vp in doctrine and holy precepts, drawne out of the word.</hi> The like was comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to parents in the old law: <hi>Let theſe wordes,</hi>

               <hi>which I commaund thee this day, be in thine heart, and whet them vpon thy children, and speake of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, when thou walkest in the way, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou lyeſt downe, and when thou riſest vp, &amp;c.</hi> So that it is not enough to bring thy children to bee catechiſed at the Church, but thou muſt labour with them at home after a more plaine and eaſier manner of inſtruction, that ſo they may the better profite by the publike teaching. Looke Pro. 22.6. Thou euen by breeding thy children, haſt helped them into corruption, &amp; a damnable eſtate: how oughteſt thou then, by al holy care and paines taken with them, in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them the knowledge of God in Chriſt, helpe them out of it, that they may not be fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of hell? And for ſeruants, ſeeing they ſpend their ſtrength, &amp; wearie out their bodies, and beſtow their dayes and yeeres in ſeeking
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8506:24"/> their profit and eaſe: oughteſt not thou then to ſeeke the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſoules? <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, the iuſt man hath regarde to his beaſt, much more ſhouldeſt thou haue regard to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, who is made according to the image of God with thee, &amp; is redeemed with as deere a price, as thou art. And thy care for him, ſhould not ſtretch to his body alone, but eſpecially to his ſoule, that ſeeing his calling will not ſuffer him to vſe ſo many, &amp; ſo often meanes for the good of it, as were requiſite, hee might herein be helped by thee.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſpeciall is, an acquainting them with the Scriptures, by reading them dayly in thy houſe,<note place="margin">Reading the ſcriptures.</note> in their hearing, and directing them to marke, and make vſe of thoſe things which are plaine and eaſie, according to their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.<note place="margin">2.

This ſhall make them the fitter to heare and profite by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like miniſterie. Whereas the neglect of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie makes them vnable to heare and vnderſtand the Preacher, when hee citeth examples, or quoteth texts, out of ſundry places of ſcripture. The helpe that their familie might reape by it, ſhould make them carefull, in this reading of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in looking that they profite by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8506:25"/> publike miniſterie of the word &amp; Sacraments, euery one according to their capacitie: and this duty requireth, that they ſhould not only looke that they do diligently frequent the preaching of the word, and carefully come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in due time, but alſo that they ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how, and put them in mind of preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the word &amp; Sacraments, as <hi>Iob</hi> did his ſons. Prepare them to heare the word by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Gods ordinance, his promiſe, and their own neceſſity, &amp;c. by laying aſide al ſuch cares, thoughts and affections, as might hinder them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a diligent hearing. To the Sacraments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, by conſidering of Gods inſtitution, the miniſterie of his Sacraments, his mercie in Ieſus Chriſt, their faith, their repentance, &amp; their wants, and ſo ſeeking aſſurance of grace, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, &amp; comfort, to come to the Lords table.</p>
            <p>Againe, to further their profit, they muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently examine them, what they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what vſe they can put ſuch doctrine, &amp; alſo helpe and direct them, wherein they faile. Thus did our Sauior Chriſt his diſciples.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.15.16.17.</note> Beſides, they muſt call vpon them, for the practiſe of that, which they learne out of the worde, that the worde grow not to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon matter, of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſe, but to talke of, vpon the Sabboth day.</p>
            <p>The fourth ſpecial duty, that belongeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, is, that they teach them how to make vſe of Gods works, either paſt, or preſent, as of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8506:25"/> examples of his mercie and goodnes, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by them, to truſt in him: by workes of his iuſtice, to be moued to feare him, and ſo to ſowe the ſeedes of conſcience and religion in them. Thus did <hi>Abraham. Geneſ.</hi> 18.19. which care of his, moued the Lorde to reueale his purpoſe to him, of deſtroying the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</p>
            <p>The duties which they are to require of them, concerning godlineſſe, bee, to vſe the publicke Miniſtrie carefully: to be diligent and reuerent in the priuate worſhip of God: to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to priuate inſtruction of all ſortes and to make their vſe of it, to the building vp of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in faith: and laſtly, to practiſe all holy and chriſtian duties, which beeing compriſed brieflie in the ten Commaundements, are more largely layd open, by the publike miniſtrie of the word, and by priuate Catechiſing.</p>
            <p>But after what manner muſt they require theſe duties? We anſwere, not onely by telling of them, what they muſt do, and calling vpon them, for the doing of it, and by gentle admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, when they bee backward, but alſo by correcting them, if they ſhall be negligent and contemptuous in the practiſe of them.</p>
            <p>This correcting is either by
<list>
                  <item>Rebuking, or</item>
                  <item>Chaſtiſing</item>
               </list> them, according to the qualitie of the fault,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8506:26"/> and the condition of the partie, that is ſo to be dealt with.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 27.5. and 29.19.</note>Correction is a ſharpe thing, and therefore not eaſilie borne of our nature, which is full of ſelfe-loue, and through the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is turned into an occaſion of great fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes, ſturdines, and naughtines, where it is not wiſely dealt in.

            <p>Firſt, the end of correcting.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the matters which muſt bee corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the maner of correcting.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ende in correcting, muſt not bee to wrecke and reuenge thine anger, or malice, or to reuenge thy ſelfe for an iniurie done, nor yet alone ly the preuenting of the like hurt, by the like fault afterward: but in zeale of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, who is diſhonoured by the lewdnes of the offender, and in loue to the partie. Thou muſt ſeeke by wiſe correction, to reclaime him from ſuch euill, as bringeth danger to him, and make him more careful of his dutie afterwards.

            <p n="2">2. For the matters that deſerue correction, this is a rule, that there muſt bee no rebuking, much leſſe chaſtiſing, but where there is a fault: for where any is vniuſtly corrected, beſides the iniurie, it hurteth him, by hardning him againſt iuſt correction, for he will thinke that it is the raſh haſtines of his gouernour, that putteth him to ſmart, and not his owne deſert.</p>
            <p>By fault I meane, not onely the committing of that which was forbidden, but alſo the omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that good which was commaunded. But euery ſuch fault is not to be cenſured with correction: ſometime ignorance, or miſtaking, ouerſight, and deſire to pleaſe in one thing, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth inferiours to offend in others. Except there bee contempt, or willing negligence, or retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ouerſight, a gentle admonition may ſerue. And indeede, Superiours muſt take heede of comming to the greateſt remedies of correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too ſoone, for ſo they may ſoone marre the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by ouer-ſharpe dealing, which by a wiſe proceeding by degrees, might haue been gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Furthermore, Gouernours muſt know yet more expreſly, what to correct. Some neuer cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, but for their owne matters, neuer regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the faults committed againſt God. But the godly Gouernour, that aimeth at Gods glorie, and ſeeketh the Lord, and not himſelfe, he is moſt grieued for diſorders in his familie,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8506:27"/> that tend to Gods diſhonour, and ſuch he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth moſt carefully. And as for defaults of his familie, that are againſt himſelfe, he looketh more to Gods diſhonour by them, then to his owne hurt or loſſe, &amp; in zeale of God is drawne to correct, and not of ſelfe-loue. He therefore counteth theſe things worthie of correction, if any delight in the ignorance of God, bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to approue himſelfe, as one that wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on him, loueth him, feareth him, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceth him, laboureth to approue al his waies, before him. If any be giuen to Idolatrie and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and careth not in euery part for the worſhip of God, to follow his reuealed wil: or if in the parts commanded, he appeare negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and colde, or to put them to any other vſe, then is commanded: or to be giuen to images, ſuperſtitious monuments, cuſtomes, occaſions, or ſuch like: if any diſhonor the name of God, either in the vnreuerent vſing, or abuſing, or peruerting, and not vſing with that preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, feeling at the preſent time, and fruit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is preſcribed, his titles, word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, workes. And if any prophane his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, by vaine paſtimes, and gaming, as Cards, Dice, dancing, &amp;c. going to playes, or giue not himſelfe to the exerciſes appointed on that day, out of the word: If any neglect ſpeciall duties towards their equals, ſuperiour, or inferiour in yeares, gifts, authoritie; as Magiſtrates, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8506:27"/> Maſters, Parents, ſeruants, children, or people: If any declare not a conſcience to flie euill, anger, malice, conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, quarelling, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or any hurting of the perſon of man, either in ſoule or bodie, not being carefull to ſuccour the ſame, according to his calling: If any bee found vnchaſte, in bodie, words, countenance, or geſture; vntemperate in diet, in apparell diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, not caring to maintaine the contrarie holineſſe in himſelfe and others: If any care not for the goods of another man, but by falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, flatterie, and oppreſſion, diminiſh the ſame: If he bee negligent in increaſing of his owne, by honeſt and lawful meanes: If he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend it, in Cards, Dice, gaming, &amp;c. If any care not to maintaine the good names of others but be giuen to vnneceſſarie blaſing of other mens infirmities, by lying, ſlaundering, backbyting, taunting: If any ſhew himſelfe careleſſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the motions and entiſements vnto ſin, and the luſts of the ſame: then they ſhall vſe the meanes following, to redreſſe them.</p>

            <p>And according to theſe things, wiſedome wil teach a man to meaſure out correction, or to be ſparing in it. Beſides, wiſedome will not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, before the fault be euident, or that ſhe be able to winde the offender out of all ſhifting holes. For when the offender is not throughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced, he ſhifteth off the ſhame of the fault, and of the correction, which is a part of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8506:28"/> to cure his diſeaſe: and beſides, he will bee bold to open his mouth againſt his Ruler, and ſeek to bring him into hatred, or contempt, with the reſt of the inferiours, for correcting vniuſtly. Wiſedome therefore will winke at a fault a while, &amp; make as though ſhe ſaw it not, that ſhe may haue a fitter oportunitie to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect: yea towards ſome of a good nature, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will ſhew, that ſhe ſeeth a fault: but yet for loue of the partie, and deſire to haue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend of his owne accord, ſhe will paſſe ouer the euill. Moreouer, wiſedome will neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the offender, by reuiling, or tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting him with the fault, but miniſter correction in loue, and deſire to haue his ſore cured, and his credit ſalued. For the caſting of faults in their teeth, and diſgracing them, eſpecially before others, which is common in the world, maketh them lay off ſhame of offending, by little and little: whereas, if they ſaw thee carefull of their credit, they would haue more regard to it themſelues.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, wiſedome will auoide partialitie, and deale with all, in the ſame caſe, after the ſame maner. Patience is alſo needfull, that through anger, or haſtines, a man do not fight nor chide,<note place="margin">Patience is a ſtedfaſtneſſe, in ſuffering the euils, that come to vs by any worke, ſo that they can not diſcourage vs. Phil. 4.5.</note> before hee hath made the fault manifeſt to the offender, that if it may be, his conſcience may be touched for it. Againe, by patience, one muſt heare what the offender can ſay in his defence, and not diſdaine to heare him, modeſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8506:29"/> for himſelfe, and when his defence is made by equity, to allow, or diſallow the ſame. So did <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 13. verſe. 13. and <hi>Balaam</hi> did not diſdaine to heare the defence of his beaſt. Numb. 22.30. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This patience alſo will keepe a man from bitterneſſe, which might ſooner make the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie angry, then draw him to amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: which thing the Apoſtle would haue auoyded in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.21. Epheſ. 6.4.9.</note> towards thoſe that bee vnder them. For want of this, many are at a word and a blow: many firſt correct, and then tell the fault: many lay on loade, or raile, and reuile, braule, and ſcolde, without meaſure.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this patience will keepe thee from anger, (a needfull thing in a correcter) for hee that commeth to reforme with anger, ſhall hardlie keepe a meaſure in rebuking, or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing.</p>
            <p>Now for the ſeuerall kinds of correction, the firſt is Rebuking, which is a ſharpe reproofe for a fault committed, meaſured according to the nature of the fault: as <hi>Iacob,</hi> Geneſis 30.2. <hi>Job</hi> 2.10. Our Sauiour Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16. verſ. 23. and to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> Luk. 9. verſ. 55. <hi>Elie</hi> 1. Sam. 2.23. &amp;c. rebuked his ſonnes, but not according to the qualitie of their fault, which turned to his, and their ruine. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this, wiſely done, is declared by <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prouer. 23.15. <hi>The rod and rebuke, giue wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8506:29"/> but the child let alone, ſhameth his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reproofe may haue ſome threatning of chaſtiſement ioyned with it, if need bee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end to make it ſincke the deeper with them. Pro. 19.19. Be thou very angry when thou par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneſt a fault, ſaying, that thou for ſparing him now, wilt puniſh him the ſorer, if he tranſgreſſe againe. But threatnings muſt not bee vaine words, without effect, but alwaies if amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follow not, thou muſt performe what was threatned, leaſt thou become light and vaine in the offenders eyes.</p>
            <p>Chaſtiſement is, when with a ſharpe rebuke, puniſhment is alſo laid vpon the offender, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to diſcretion.</p>
            <p>If any man thinke fighting vnmeet for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or be loth to foile their hands, leaſt they ſhould get themſelues an ill name; let them know, that Gods ordinance is not a matter of an ill report, but onely amongſt fooles, that know not what is good and meete. Now, that houſehold chaſtiſement is agreeable to Gods will, is euident out of the Prouerbs, where the wiſedome of God doth very often commend it to vs, as chap. 13.24. <hi>He that ſpareth the rod, hateth his ſonne: but he that loueth him cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth him betime.</hi> Where he requireth, that it be not deferred till it be too late, that is, till the offender be hardened in ill: but giuen in time,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8506:30"/> before he be paſt recouerie. He ſaith it is a fruit of true and pure loue, to correct in due time, and very loue in parents and care of their chidren, muſt draw them to it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he ſaith, Parents neuer knew what true loue of children ment, but imbrace fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and fooliſh pitie in ſtead of it, who doe ſpare to correct, when correction is deſerued.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that this fondneſſe and fooliſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is indeede hatred, and not loue: the reaſon why it is to bee counted hatred, is ſet downe, Prou. 19.18. <hi>Chastiſe thy ſonne while there is hope, and let not thy ſoule ſpare him, to his destruction.</hi> Where hee plainly ſaith, that fond pittying and ſparing of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to work the deſtruction of them: and is it not a token of great hatred, to be a meanes of anothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? Elſewhere he ſheweth the neceſſitie of correction, and the good which it doth: Pro. 22.15. <hi>Fooliſhnes is bound in the heart of a childe, but the rod of correction ſhall remoue it farre from him.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, much follie and lewdnes is couched in a childs heart, which if it be not purged, will burſt foorth into foule enormities, and therefore a purgation is but needfull, and what may that be, but <hi>the rod of correction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame is commanded, Pro. 29.17. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thy ſonne:</hi> where alſo he ſheweth, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit commeth thereby to the parents: <hi>He ſhall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8506:30"/> giue thee reſt, yea he will giue pleaſures to thy ſoule:</hi> that is, thou ſhalt bee free from ſorrow, heauines, and many troubles, which many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents haue with vngracious children: and on the other ſide, thou ſhalt haue much comfort and delight by them. Great benefit alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thereby to the children, as he ſheweth in the 15. verſe; <hi>The rod and correction giue wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And chap. 23.13.14. whereas the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it, bringeth hurt to the child, and to the parents, as followeth: <hi>A childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.</hi> And for ſeruants, the Wiſeman doth cloſely ſhew, how they muſt be dealt with all, where he ſaith, Pro. 29.21. <hi>He which bringeth vp his ſeruant delicately from his youth, at length will be depriued of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> And a little before, verſe 19. he ſaith: <hi>A ſeruant wil not be chastiſed with words: though he vnderſtand, yet he will not anſwere, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Scriptures ſhew, that God hath put the rod of correction in the hands of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the familie, by puniſhment to ſaue them from deſtruction; which if the bridle were let looſe vnto them, they would runne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Where men and women are content to goe contrarie to their owne nature, and to vndergo ill reports, to obey the ordinance of God, there God will giue a bleſsing, that is, a well ordered familie, wherein all ſhall be of good hope.</p>

               <hi>Salomon</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and ſetteth talking and great reckoning, of what they will do.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to dooing, can finde no fit time to begin.</p>
            <p>Now, to finiſh this point of diligence to bee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8506:35"/> vſed in our calling, marke the good husbandrie which the ſpirit of God teacheth. Prou. 27.23. <hi>Be diligent to know the ſtate of thy flocke, and take heed to thy heards, for riches remaine not alwaies.</hi> Where he willeth men not to truſt all to ſeruants, for the care of their cattel and other commodities, but to looke diligently to them themſelues: the reaſon is, for that their riches be not ſo glewed to them, but that if they bee not carefully looked vnto, they will take their leaue and be gone. And ſo we ſee, it often comes to paſſe, that they which doe their buſines by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, haue other to thriue for them.</p>
            <p>But here peraduenture, ſome husbands and wiues will ſay: Ye ſpeake much of good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie, and good huſwiferie; but how would you haue them to be good husbands, and good huſwiues, that haue not wherwith to be a good husband, or good huſwife on? Whereunto we anſwere, that good husbandrie and good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery, conſiſteth not ſo much in hauing much or little, as in the wiſe, carefull, diſcreet, &amp; good forecaſting of that, which God in mercie hath inabled and inriched them with, to ſee euery thing well ordered, and imployed to a good end and vſe. For we by experience doe ſee, that ſome husbands, and wiues, can ſo husbandly and huſwifely diſpoſe, ſet forth, and make a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſhew of a little, and cauſe it to ſtretch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then many can do with much, and can do
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8506:35"/> as much with twentie Nobles, as ſome can doe with twentie or thirtie pounds.</p>
            <p>As a calling muſt be followed with dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſo alſo there is wiſedome, skill, and diſcretion to be vſed in it. For as in lifting of a great waight, a mightie ſtrong man, wanting cunning, can not mooue that, though hee ſtraine and bruſe himſelfe much, which a weake man will doe with a ſleight. So dealing in any calling, ſome man ſhall toyle exceedingly much, and yet for want of wit and diſcretion, not doe halfe the good, that another ſhall with more eaſe: Prou. 13.23. He that hath a trade, let him learne to be cunning in it, and able to goe through with it, Prou. 16.20. And to the end he may walke on ſurer ground, let him not diſdaine to aske aduiſe and counſell, for the praiſe of contriuing matters well, by his owne wit, is not ſo great, as is the loſſe and ignominie, when for want of counſell, a man entreth a wrong courſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Salomon</hi> doth commend this wiſedome vnto vs often, to take heede of haſtineſſe, headi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſelfe-will, and to beware of ouer-weening in our owne reach. Prou. 15.22. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counſel, thoughts,</hi> that is, intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, <hi>come to nought: but in the multitude of counſell, there is ſtedfastnes.</hi> And 20.18. <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh thy thoughts by counſell, and by counſell make warre.</hi> Whereas on the other ſide, haſte bringeth waſte. <hi>Whoſoeuer is hastie,</hi> that is, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8506:36"/> raſhly goeth about his buſineſſe without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, <hi>commeth ſurely to pouertie.</hi> Pro. 21.5. That is notable in the 29.20. <hi>Seeſt thou a man haſtie in his matter, there is more hope of a Foole, then of him.</hi> The ſame is ſaid of the conceited man, <hi>Seeſt thou a man wiſe in his owne conceit? there is more hope of a Foole then of him.</hi> Pro. 26.12. When the Spirit of God doth ſo carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this thing to vs, wee muſt needs thereby ſee, that it is a matter of great neceſſitie, and of excellent vſe, for as the Prouerbe is, two eies ſee more then one. And many times, men ſee more clearelie in other mens matters, then in their owne. In this caſe alſo, it is good to looke to the examples of others, and our owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuch like caſes, for much light com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into a wiſe mans mind by this windowe. And to the ende, that thou mayeſt make thy vſe of experience and examples, when occaſion ſhall ſerue, it is good to marke things, which ſhall fall out, the beginnings, proceedings, and euents of matters, and keep them in minde to ſtand thee in ſtead: for hee that neuer maketh any thing, it is all one, as if hee had neuer ſeen or heard them, and ſuch a one muſt alwaies bee running for counſell, in euery light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or elſe may take a wrong courſe, except hee can ſtumble on the right way by good hap. This obſeruation and pondering of euents, with the cauſes that went before, is the ripener
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8506:36"/> of wit. But idlemindedneſſe, and careleſſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting paſſe of matters, maketh an emptineſſe in the head, of ſuch good things, as make one man excell an other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in following thy calling, let not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,<note place="margin">Iuſtice is a vertue, that yeeldeth to euerie man his owne.</note> and vpright dealing be forgotten, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy dealings by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If there were no other, yet this reaſon ſhould weigh with thee, that ſo thou mighteſt looke to reap good dealing at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens hands, as it is ſaid. Pro. 25.21. <hi>He that followeth after righteouſneſſe, and mercie, ſhall finde life, righteouſneſſe and glorie.</hi> Where as ſuch as meaſure out hard meaſure to others, they haue the like meaſured to them againe: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of our Sauiour Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the riches gotten by ill meanes, haue a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie deſtinie vttered againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>The gathering of riches by a deceitfull tongue, is vanitie, toſſed to and fro of them that ſeeke death.</hi> Pro. 21.6.</p>
            <p>As iuſtice and equal dealing toward all men muſt be looked vnto, ſo God will haue vs not to omit mercifulneſſe,<note place="margin">Mercifulneſſe is a paſſion of the mind, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedly, and ſhamefully are afflicted, proceeding from thoſe that be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with pittie and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> and frendly dealing to the poore.

Verſe. 24. hee ſheweth how a man ſhall preſerue this treaſure which is ſo good. <hi>A man that hath friends, muſt ſhew himſelfe friendly.</hi> Hereto agreeth that of the heathen: he that would haue a good neighbour, muſt be a good neighbour. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 24.27. Verſe. He ſeemeth to giue a rule for the right order of managing a mans Houſehold affaires; ſaying: <hi>Prepare thy worke without, and make readie thy things in the field, &amp; afterward thou maiſt build thine houſe.</hi> As though hee ſhould ſay, firſt looke after ſuch things as are needfull and neceſſarie for houſe-keeping, as that thou maiſt haue prouiſion, &amp;c: and then, when that is prouided for, thou maiſt fall a trimming vp of thy houſe. But many fooles, beginne firſt to decke their houſes, before they lay for neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and are faine afterwards to ſell their orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with loſſe, to prouide more neceſſarie matters. It is a good point of wiſedome, to beare the want of that longeſt, which may beſt be ſpared.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sparing is good getting, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt rent that one can haue.</note>The laſt rule is, that a good gouernour of a familie, for the better maintenance of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, muſt be frugall (or to ſpeake engliſh) a good husband, that is ſparing and ſauing, and ſo to order and moderate himſelfe, that if his goods and reuenues bee not ſufficient for him and his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8506:39"/> charge, then to make himſelfe ſufficient for his goods: and to diſpoſe of himſelfe according to the olde prouerbe: So to cut his coate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his cloth, and to eate within his owne tether. Yet we would not haue him pinching, or niggardly, and ſo dried vp for liberalitie, that nothing ſhould be wroong from him for good vſes: that is, too farre on the left hand, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie is on the right. But where there is no iuſt cauſe to ſpend or lay out, and it might be as well ſpared, there we would haue him ſaue, for his riches be the Lords goods, which God hath made him a ſteward of: when the Lorde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wils him to open his hand there let him not be ſtraight handed: but where nothing but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulie luſts and pomp, or vain glory, bid him drawe, there is hee to hold faſt: for hee is an ill ſteward, that will lay out his maiſters goods where there is no need, or where leſſe would ſerue. There be many, who of a greedy and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous mind, will eaſily imbrace this precept of ſparing: but as they do it of a wrong purpoſe, ſo they faile in the matters, wherein they ſhould ſaue and bee ſparing. Many miſers pinch their ſeruants in their meate and drinke, allowing them not inough, or not good inough, and this they take to be frugalitie and thrift: whereas to prancke, and pricke vp themſelues in brauery, and that ſometimes aboue their calling, herein they are very lauiſh. This is no more to be coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8506:40"/> frugalitie, or good husbandrie, then to rob a poore man, to giue to the rich, is true liberalitie. When therefore thou thinkeſt of ſparing let not the greedie deſire of gathering draw thee to it, but conſcience of well vſing that which God hath lent thee. And this mind will draw thee to ſpare and ſaue, onely there, where it may be wel done, and not there, where in conſcience thou oughteſt to ſpend. Now the better to further our ſelues in this honeſt thriftineſſe, or frugality, that is called of one, a great reuenew, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of needleſſe expences muſt bee auoided. Loue not mirth and paſtime, for they haue oft occaſion of expences. Againe, they cauſe loſſe of time, and neglect of buſineſſe at home, yea, and often ſuch doo buy their pleaſures with loſſe in their goods, while retchleſſe maiſters haue either theeuiſh, or careleſſe ſeruants. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Salomon</hi> telleth ſuch their fortune Pro. 11.17. <hi>Hee that loueth mirth or paſtime, will bee a poore man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a ſweete tooth, &amp; a veluet mouth, that is, daintineſſe, or choiceneſſe in diet, is an enimie to frugalitie, a needleſſe charge, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the taſte for a moment, whereas whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meat and drinke, would be more eaſe for the purſe, and healthfull for the bodie. <hi>He that loueth Wine and Oyle, that</hi> is, ſweete delicats for his ſences, <hi>will not be rich.</hi> Pro. 27.17.</p>
            <p>In this ranke doo march gluttonie, I meane

Theſe dul the mind and wit, dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken reaſon, and make a man become ſottiſh. Beſides, they ſtuffe the body with groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which breed diſeaſes, and diſeaſes bring other charges for phiſicke, or at leaſt, loſſe of time, and neglect of buſineſſe, which doo coſt a man as much as his diet, wherein hee was exceſſiue, ſo that theſe euills haue double expences.</p>
            <p>To be briefe in this point, God hauing read the deſtinie of the drunkard,<note place="margin">Drunkenneſſe is a vice, when any doth gull in ouermuch drinke.</note> and the glutton, namely, that many euils, and namelie pouertie, ſhall betide them, Pro. 23.21.29.30.31.

            <p>A great backfriend to thrift, is good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and companie keeping: for it hath loſſe of time, and draweth thee away from thy calling, and hindereth the due ouerſeeing of good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands affaires: it maketh a man ouerſlippe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of doing good things in a due and fitte ſeaſon: beſides, it draweth home others to thy houſe, or draweth thee to other houſes, as Tauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Alehouſes, &amp; ſuch like; the haunting wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is a thing of no good report: and it maketh thee lauiſh in ſpending, or elſe it is no good-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, (as they ſay) &amp; by meanes therof, thou ſhalt <hi>feede the gluttons,</hi> and ſpend that vppon

            </p>
            <p>As to haue a faithfull friend, is a matter auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thrift; ſo by his friends a man may bee endammaged. There is a friendſhip, which is very coſtly, and chargeable to maintaine. Hee that deſireth familiaritie with great men, muſt haue other things ſuteable; as coſtly apparell, well trimmed houſes, often inuitings to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, to recompence their kindnes, he muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their humours, and not ſtick to neglect his affaires, to haue their companie when he may.

For while a ſimple-hearted man ſuſpecteth no hurt, he watcheth his occaſions to ſpeede him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of a bootie: a matter that by the counſell of the holy Ghoſt oft repeated in the Prouerbs, is as carefully to be auoided, as it is hurtfull to a mans eſtate.

And by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting to thy houſe, he hath furniſhed himſelfe with ſome thing to diſcredite thee, except thou haſt walked marueilous warily, which a man can hardly doe before flatterers.</p>
            <p>To end this matter of friendſhip, haue ſome neere friends but not many.

Wherefore, except a man can finde a faithfull friend indeede, it is good to remember the olde ſaying: <hi>My ſecrets to my ſelfe.</hi> Whereto our common prouerbe anſwereth: <hi>Two may keepe counſell, if one bee away.</hi> The Wiſeman aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it to follie, to powre out a mans ſecrets lightlie: <hi>The foole powreth out all his minde,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As hurt commeth by ſome friends, ſo alſo by enemies many are ſore annoyed. What charges in lawing, and other troubles, bee there in the world through enmitie? VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good wiſedome, by all good meanes to auoide breaches, which breede enmitie: and by all friendlie, iuſt, and wiſe dealing, to keepe peace and good-will euen with the meaneſt. The weakeſt enemie is not to bee contemned. It ſhall goe harde, but at one time or other, hee will worke thee ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: at leaſt his mouth ſhall alwaies bee open to ſpeake ill, to miſconſter thy actions, and to blaze abroad thy infirmities, &amp; ſcapes.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8506:43"/> Hee that would haue no enemies, muſt make himſelfe none, by vniuſt, vnkinde, or vnneigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourlie dealing: but rather by courteouſnes of ſpeech, helpfulnes, and good neighbourhood, to winne the loue and liking of men: yet a man may be too wiſe in this point. Many being loth to incurre any mans diſpleaſure, will not ſeeke to vpholde right and equitie, ſpeake for the poore, ſtand out to maintaine Gods cauſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is diſhonoured by open ſinne: as ſwearing, lying, rayling, and ſuch like. Many to keepe in withall, vſe all companies alike: for auoyding a mans companie, breedeth a grudge. But the good will of men, is neuer to be purchaſed with forſaking of dutie. Such things as may iuſtly be ill taken, auoide for peace ſake. Whereof the Wiſeman noteth ſome: as, medling in other mens matters:<note place="margin">Prou. 26.17.</note> 
               <hi>He that medleth with a ſtrife, that belongeth not to him, is as he that taketh a dogge by the eares:</hi> that is, caſteth himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dangers.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Prou. 29.9.10.</note>2. Be not haſtie to go to law, no not in a right cauſe, but agree at home. For beſides that, a man doth ſeldome ſcape without great loſſe, (in which reſpect it is alſo to bee auoided, as an enemie to thrift) thy neighbour is openly put to reproach, becommeth thy mortall enemie, and will alwaies watch to doe thee hurt.</p>

               <note place="margin">Pro. 20.22.24.25.</note>3. Sometime to ſeeke reuenge of a wrong, breedeth greater malice in the author of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8506:43"/> wrong, and maketh him double it, as a man ſpurreth his horſe for kicking, when hee was ſpurred. <hi>Say not, I will recompence euill: but wait vpon the Lord, and he will ſaue thee.</hi>
            </p>

But commit thy ſelfe to God, and turne thy minde to make vſe of thine enemie. Let enmitie, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies prying and ſeeking occaſions to hurt by word or deede, make thee to walke, not more cloſely, but more vprightly: and then mayſt thou defie thine enemie:<note place="margin">Prou. 10.9.</note> 
               <hi>For he that walketh vprightly, walketh boldly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another enemie to thrift, (which is alſo a breaker of peace and good will among men) is much borrowing. He that is to borrow, doth ſpend much time, and let ſlip many occaſions of doing his buſineſſe in the due ſeaſon: hee muſt repay in better meaſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he borrowed, or elſe ill words, or ill will will follow. If it bee a matter of any value, which is borrowed, then as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Prou. 22.7.</note> 
               <hi>The borrower is ſeruant to the lender:</hi> that is beholding to him, and in his danger. The thriftieſt men loue leaſt to bee
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8506:44"/> beholden to others, and therefore ſeldome ſeek, and often refuſe, euen when they bee offered to receiue benefits at other mens hands. He that goeth a borrowing, goeth a ſorrowing. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery deniall he receiueth, where he thinketh he ſhould ſpeed, is the ſeede of grudge in the mind of the denier, and of him who is denied. But of all borrowing, to borrow vpon vſurie is the deereſt buying, and the rankeſt poyſon to thrift. When <hi>Dauid</hi> would wiſh a ſore plague to his enemie, he prayeth that he may be giuen into the vſurers hands: <hi>Let the vſurer eate him vp.</hi> If the vſurer be a deuourer, woe be to them that come in his hands.</p>
            <p>To auoide borrowing, a good husband muſt cut off all vnneceſſarie expences, that hee may haue all neceſſaries in his houſe. To auoide borrowing of money, take heede of ſuertiſhip, of dealing in bargaines which you are not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to compaſſe, of dealing in many things, and hauing too many yrons in the fire at once. Looke how you can compaſſe matters, before you enterpriſe them Prouide long before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any day of payment, and haue not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to ſeeke vpon the ſudd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n: for that driues a man to borrowing, yea to vſurie, or to Robin Hoods penyworths.</p>
            <p>Beſides, he muſt keepe none in his houſe idle, or halfe ſet to worke, none more then needes muſt. Let euery one haue his charge, that will
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8506:44"/> throughly occupie him: alſo looke that they doe their tasks, euery one in his place, and haue an often eie vnto them, whether they haue done as they ſhould doe.

Here is to be remembred, a thing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to marriage, and going before it: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Betrothing,</hi> beeing a ſolemne and laudable cuſtome of Gods children, as is proued, Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teron.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8506:56"/> 20.7. &amp; 22.23, 24. This <hi>Betrothing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is.</note> is a couenant betweene the parties to bee married, before fit witneſſes appointed thereto: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they giue their troth, that they will, and ſhal marrie togither, except ſome lawfull vnmeete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſliking of each of other, do hinder it in the meane time. The practiſe of it we ſee: Matth. 1.18. Luke 1.27. Where the Virgine <hi>Marie</hi> beeing betrothed to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> yet they had not mette togither, to wit, to accompany togither according to the ende of marriage. This cuſtome, noted and marked in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scripture, hath diuers good grounds to be obſerued, which proue, that there ought to be a contract before marriage. And for the ter vnderſtanding of this point of <hi>Betrothing,</hi> it ſhall not be amiſſe, in ſome plaine and ſhort manner, to make knowne the holy doctrine hereof, with the doctrine alſo of marriage, and marriage duties. Firſt then we muſt know, that euery mariage, that hath bin well and orderly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, either of the heathen (which were only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the law of nature) or of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, who alſo were to be directed by his word, was perfected by two ſolemne actions: that is, by an apparant &amp; open contract and by publike mariage, the true &amp; vnfained co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof. Wherfore we wil firſt ſpeak of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract (which is alſo called eſpouſing, affiancing, betrothing, or hand faſting) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mariage it ſelf.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8506:57"/> And for betrothing, or eſpouſals, we reade in the writing of ancient Philoſophers, Hiſtories, Orators, Poets and others, that they be of great antiquitie, of neceſſarie vſe, and haue been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily practiſed. Inſomuch, as the vſers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are highly commended, the neglecters and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſers hereof, ſharply rebuked and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Which ſeeing they could not do, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowledge and iudgement, it doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declare, that they did it by natures lawe, written and bred in their breaſts. And therefore that euen nature it ſelfe, though in ſome matters ſtarke blinde, and in many of very dim ſight: yet ſhe hath in all ages bewraied the lawfulnes, the neceſſitie, and the vſe of eſpouſals, to be the firſt ſtep and degree, to a lawfull and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table marriage.</p>
               <p>But to omit this lawe, and to come to the written word, let vs further conſider what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance we finde in the ſame, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it is, not onely to marrie, not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction of nature, but alſo in the Lord. Firſt it is certaine, that the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth them as his owne ſacred ordinance: for we reade in Exodus 21.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. how carefully hee prouideth by ſundry and many ſtraight commaundements for the Maide-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant that is betrothed. Firſt, that ſhe ſhall not goe out of her ſeruice, as the Men-ſeruants doe. Secondly, that her Maſter ſhall haue no power
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8506:57"/> to ſell her to a ſtrange people. Thirdly, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betrothed vnto his ſonne, hee ſhall deale with her as with his owne doughter. Fourthly, if another wife bee taken with her, that neither her foode, her raiment, nor recompence of her Virginitie, ſhall any whit at all be diminiſhed. Fiftly, that whenſoeuer ſhe goeth out of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, ſhe ſhal pay no money at al. None where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Lord would haue done (much leſſe all of them) vnleſſe eſpowſalls had been his owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, inſtituted, ordained and commaunded by himſelfe to bee vſed, euen of the Maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, that was bought and ſold. Againe it is written in Deut. 22.23, &amp;c. how the Lord by like commandement, prouideth for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſpowſed maid, being inoffenſiue, yet beeing guiltie, hee puniſheth with leſſe puniſhment, then if ſhee had been indeed married. Firſt then hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, that if any man ſhal abuſe a betrothed virgine in the Citie, both ſhall bee ſtoned to death, the Maide becauſe ſhe cried not, the man becauſe hee hath humbled his neighbours wife. Where by the way, is to be remembred, how God calleth the betrothed, a wife. If then ſuch wickedneſſe by iuſtice deſerueth death, and if betrothed perſons bee truely to be termed man and wife, onely in regard of the precedent eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powſals, wee may then plainly ſee, how highly the Lord doth eſteeme and honour them: the breach whereof, he puniſheth with the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8506:58"/> of adulterie, &amp; the perſons betrothed, hee honoureth with the names of man and wife. If indeed he had not ordained and allowed them, but that they had been of humane inſtitution alone, he would not haue honoured them with ſuch titles, or haue impoſed death by ſtones, for the breach of mans ordinance. Againe, if a man abuſe a betrothed maid in the field, hee ſaith, that the man ſhall die, but vnto the maid thou ſhalt doo nothing, becauſe there is in the maid no cauſe of death.</p>
               <p>Now impoſing death vppon this man, and not vpon him that abuſeth a maid not betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Lorde doth hereby euidently teach, that eſpowſals are a principall degree in marriage. And therfore the vnlawfull breach thereof deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth death. For what elſe ſhould y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord grace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with ſuch great priuiledges, and puniſh the breach thereof, with ſeuere puniſhment?</p>
               <p>Further, the faithfull in all ages inſtructed by theſe, and ſuch commaundements, approued and practiſed theſe eſpowſals, not onely by themſelues,<note place="margin">Iudg. 14.1, &amp;c.</note> but alſo by their children. <hi>Sampſon</hi> liking and louing a woman of the <hi>Philistines</hi> in <hi>Timnah,</hi> deſired his Father and Mother to giue her to him to wife: and ſo they did: at which time <hi>Sampſon</hi> made a feaſt, according to the cuſtome of the yong men. Albeit, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afterward would not ſuffer him to marrie her, but gaue her to another: for which iniurie

                  <hi>Sampſon</hi> reuenged himſelfe of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> by burning vp the ricks of ſtanding corne, vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes, and Oliues. For which the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> burnt both the Father and the daughter.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.15.26.27. 2. Sam. 3.14.15.16.</note> So <hi>Dauid</hi> begged <hi>Micholl</hi> of her father <hi>Saul,</hi> who gaue her to him to wife, with condition, that hee would bring him a hundreth foreskinnes of the <hi>Philiſtines:</hi> and therefore, when <hi>Saul</hi> was dead, hee required her of <hi>Iſhboſheth, Saules</hi> ſonne, who ſent her vnto him. Alſo <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> the mother of Chriſt, were betrothed, which God would neuer haue permitted, if it had not been of his owne ordinance and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his owne wil, or if he might any manner of way, haue ſtained either <hi>Ioſephs</hi> honeſtie, or <hi>Maries</hi> virginitie: Nay if hee had not much more graced and adorned both, then the want of eſpowſals could haue done.</p>
               <p>And to auoide tediouſneſſe in ſo plaine a trueth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.36.37.38.</note> ſeeing the ſcripture giueth power and authoritie to Parents, to giue, and not to giue their children in marriage: ſaying, let him doo what he will.</p>
               <p>Againe, hee that giueth her in marriage doth well, and hee that giueth her not to marriage doth better: (whereof wee ſhall ſpeake more at large anone) there muſt needes be before the publike act of marriage, ſome ſpeciall time appoynted: wherein both Parents, and parties, may teſtify and ſignifie their mutuall liking
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8506:59"/> and conſents, vnleſſe they deſpiſe to marrie in the Lorde.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if the law of nature, the law of God, the practiſe of the Heathen, the cuſtome of Faithfull, eſpecially of the Parents of Chriſt: If the puniſhment of the eſpowſall-breakers, and the rewards and priuiledges of the eſpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And finally, if the fatherly authoritie ouer children, doo approue and require the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vſe of this ordinance of God, it muſt needes be confeſſed to be both lawfull and neceſſarie: yea being the firſt principall part of marriage it ſelfe, it muſt needes be honourable in his kind, as well as marriage it ſelfe is. Now then, in the next place, let vs ſee &amp; learne, what a contract is, to the end, that vppon ſound knowledge and right iudgement, we may alwaies vſe it wel, and neuer ill, for want of good vnderſtanding.</p>
               <q>A Contract, is a voluntarie promiſe of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, mutually made betweene one man and one woman, both beeing meete and free to marry one another, and therefore allowed ſo to do by their Parents.</q>
               <p>This ſhort ſentence, ſheweth the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, qualitie, propertie, vſe, and abuſe, with all other things, that are to be obſerued or eſchued in a right Contract, as ſhall appeare by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding of euery word contained therein: For as
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8506:59"/> there is none vaine and idle, voide of his proper ſignification, ſo euerie one hath his proper waight, ſeruing for ſpeciall and neceſſarie vſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, wee call a Contract a promiſe, and ſo it is indeed, for what is a promiſe but a ſpeech which affirmeth or denieth, to doo this or that, with pupoſe and words of teſtimonie, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and accompliſh, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is affirmed, or not to do that which is denied? And what other thing is indeed a marriage Contract, but this? ſo that it muſt be in nature, a true and right pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: not the vowe of a promiſe in time to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, but a preſent promiſe in deede. For if one partie do ſay, I will promiſe to marrie thee: this is no promiſe in deede, but a promiſe of a promiſe, and conſequently no Contract, but a promiſe of a Contract. And therefore tieth nor bindeth neither parties, nor Parents to keepe the ſame: for it is not in nature any contract at al. Againe, if a Contract be a promiſe, it is not onely a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the heart, nor a dumbe ſhewe, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſignification of promiſe: but a plaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vttered &amp; pronounced in a right forme of ſpeech: as when one ſaith, I doe promiſe to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thee, or I do eſpouſe, affiance, or betroth my ſelfe to thee in marriage, or ſuch like: wherein al ambiguitie and doubtfulneſſe of ſpeech, is to be eſchued: that as the meaning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart is ſimple and plaine, ſo likewiſe the words of the tongue, might be ſimple and plaine, voide of all deceit.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:8506:60"/>2. Secondly, we call a Contract a promiſe of mariage, becauſe it is not a promiſe of euerie thing, neither of honour, of inheritance, of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or of any other thing elſe, ſauing onely of marriage. Now wee meane by marriage, not onely the parties married, but all coniugall and mariage duties and offices, that peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this honorable eſtate, and are neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee performed mutually of both. For this promiſe, touching perſons themſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is of ſuch force &amp; waight, that it tendeth to the alienation of the propertie of bodies: for ſo it is written, the wife hath not the power of her owne bodie, but the huſband:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7, 4.</note> and likewiſe alſo the husband hath not the power ouer his owne body, but the wife. For although this is not perfectly done, till the act of marriage be ended, yet this promiſe is the principall beginner and worker thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that promiſe marriage, do neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereby promiſe, that two ſhall become one fleſh, and that they will alwaies giue mutuall beneuolence one to another.</p>
               <p>Touching the peculiar duties of husbands and wiues, which likewiſe are promiſed by this Contract, wee will here onely recite them, leauing the doctrine thereof, to another place and time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The husband his dutie is, firſt to loue his wife, as his owne fleſh. 2. Then to gouern her in all duties, that properly concerne the ſtate
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8506:60"/> of marriage, in knowledge, in wiſedome, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and iuſtice. Thirdly, to dwell with her. Fourthly, to vſe her in all due beneuolence,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 13.7. 1. Cor. 7.45.</note> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie, ſoberly, and chaſtly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The wife, her dutie is, in all reuerence and humilitie, to ſubmit and ſubiect her ſelfe to her husband, in al ſuch duties as properly belong to marriage. Secondly, therein to be an helpe vnto him, according to gods ordinance. Thirdly, to obey his commandements in all things, which hee may commaund by the authoritie of an husband. Fourthly and laſtly, to giue him mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall beneuolence. As for the reſt of mutuall duties, as they may be all comprehended vnder theſe, ſo there ſhall be a fitter occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee call this promiſe of marriage, voluntary, becauſe it muſt not come from the lippes alone, but from the wel-liking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the heart: for if it be onely a verball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, without any wil at all, (and ſo meer hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall and diſſembled) though it bindeth the partie that promiſeth, to the performance of his promiſe, made before God and man: yet if the Parents afterwards ſhall certainly know this, and that there was no will, nor vnfained mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at all in the party, neither yet is, but rather a loathing and abhorring of his ſpouſe betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, though hee bee not able to render iuſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8506:61"/> and ſufficient cauſe thereof, they maye vpon this occaſion, either deferre the day of marriage the longer, to ſee if God wil happily change the minde of the partie, or vtterly breake and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the promiſe: if all good meanes and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions hauing been vſed, none wil preuaile: but that the partie rather groweth woorſe and woorſe. For a Contract beeing a willing and a voluntarie conſent, there is no cauſe why the Parents, and ſuch as haue authoritie and power in ſuch caſes, when they ſhall vndoubtedly knowe, that the promiſe was altogither vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and therefore made in meere hypocriſie and diſſimulation, neither can bee by tract of time, or any other good meanes vſed, be better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but rather (waxeth woorſe and woorſe) may not breake and fruſtrate the ſame. For why did <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> Parents deny her to <hi>Iſaack,</hi> neither would ſend her with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeruant to bee married,<note place="margin">Gen. 24, 57.58</note> before ſuch time as they had asked her conſent: yea, when as they ſaid: Wee will call the maide, and aske her conſent: do they not plainely ſhewe, that both the law of Nature, and the law of God, taught them, that this conſent was of great moment, and abſolute neceſſitie? And when the Apoſtle doth commaund men and women, to marrie in the Lorde, how can that marriage be in the Lord, when the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doth not onely, not loue, but hate the other? And how can ſuch two become one fleſh law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8506:61"/> when as there wanteth the vnion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the heart, the true naturall mother of all marriage duties? Wherefore this promiſe muſt be in this reſpect, at leaſt, willing, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie. For albeit, it is not neceſſarie, neither yet poſſible, that there ſhould bee ſuch great meaſure of true, holy, and ſanctified loue at that time, as afterward (for that groweth by little and little, according to the bleſſing of God, and the faithfull performance of other duties afterward, euen to their liues end) yet if it bee voluntarie and vnfained, it is enough, and fully ſufficient, to make a true contract in the Lord. So, as no man ought to ſeparate thoſe, whom God hath thus ioyned. Secondly, wee call it voluntarie, in reſpect of conſtraint and compulſion, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to a free conſent: for if eyther partie bee vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, conſtrained, or compelled, by great feare of their Parents, or others, by threatning of loſſe of preferment, of health, of limme, of life, or of any ſuch other like, or by any other violent manner of dealing whatſoeuer, to yeeld their promiſe cleane contrarie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> motion of good liking of their hearts. This kinde of promiſe, as it doth not binde the partie to keepe it: ſo it ought to bee fruſtrated and broken by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents themſelues, or by ſuch maiſters as may and ought, to commaund and rule them in ſuch caſes. If this were not ſo, how could the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties keepe the commaundements of God, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8506:62"/> them direction whom to marrie? Firſt that they ſhould marrie onely in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Againe, that they ſhould not bee vnequally yoked with the infidels, neither whereof they can keepe, if their parents might compell them or Contract &amp; marrie It becommeth rather the Parents to perſwade their children by all good meanes, to yeelde their conſent, rather then to drawe them by wicked ſleight and cunning, drunkenneſſe, or any other wicked and violent meanes. For as that is not to marrie in the Lord: ſo all ſuch forced Contracts may bee broken and fruſtrated by the Magiſtrate, who is Gods Lieutenant, to redreſſe ſuch intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enormities among the ſocieties of men. For if Parents may deny marriage to ſuch as haue not onely by force and violence obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the word and body of their childe, much more may the Magiſtrate denie marriage, where onely a verball promiſe hath beene gotten by violent compulſion, and ſo for theſe cauſes, and in this ſence and meaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, wee conclude, that Contract muſt bee voluntarie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it muſt bee a mutuall promiſe, that is, either partie muſt make it to other, not the man onely, nor the woman onely, but both the man and the woman: though decencie and order require the man to doo it firſt, and then the woman, becauſe hee is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8506:62"/> her head, and ſhee his glorie: and ought to leade and guide her in all things, wherein the Lorde hath put a preheminence. For if this promiſe bee not mutually made of them both, but of one alone, it is no true and perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. And therefore may bee broken by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, and ſuch as haue authoritie heerein: becauſe the partie vnpromiſing, is not bound by word nor deede, but is free, inſomuch that ſuch a Contract is rather ſo termed, then for that it is any true Contract indeede. But if it bee mutuall, then it doth mutually and inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably binde both: ſo that in this regard, neither Parent, Magiſtrate, nor any other, can or ought to breake it. For this beeing fully performed and accompliſhed, is one principall cauſe of making two one fleſh, in ſuch ſort as it is written. Therefore ſhall man leaue his father and mother, and ſhall bee ioyned to his wife, and they two ſhall bee one fleſh, &amp;c. Geneſ. 2.24. Alſo that the man hath not power ouer his owne body, nor the woman ouer hers: and ſo to bee ſhort, hence ariſeth all mutuall beneuolence between them. And therefore a poynt of great waight and neceſſitie, in no wiſe to bee omitted in Contract.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we ſay, it muſt be betweene one man and one woman: Where firſt it is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it may not, nor ought not, to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene any other creatures, but mankinde, nay
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8506:63"/> neither among brute beaſtes, nor Angels. For God hath not ordained nor inſtituted marriage for them, neither can it bee between man and man, or woman and woman. If any ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract be either voluntarie, or by fraude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, by ignorance or errour, it is no Contract at all, but a meere wicked profanation of Gods ordinance, who gaue onely woman to man, not woman to woman, nor man to man. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it cannot bee between Angells good or badde, and woman, becauſe God hath ſet no ſuch ordinance in the nature of theſe creatures. If therefore there hath beene any ſuch matter, or ſhall be attempted by Sathan, with any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (as ſome ſtories report) it is nothing elſe but a meere illuſion and deuilliſh practiſe, to drawe and deceiue ſuperſtitious perſons into the kingdome of darkeneſſe, and to intrappe them in the chaines of condemnation: againſt which, and all other diabolicall illuſions, wee ought to watch and pray continually.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is to be obſerued, that betweene one man, and one woman, and not two men and one woman, or two women, not betweene two women and one man or moe. By which is condemned, as meere nullities and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, all Contracts whatſoeuer, made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene moe then two.<note place="margin">Math. 19.5. Mar. 10.8 Epheſ. 5.31. 1. Cor, 6.16.</note> For it is written: <hi>And they twaine ſhall be one fleſh:</hi> to which <hi>Marke</hi> addeth: <hi>So that they are no more twaine, but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8506:63"/> one fleſh.</hi> Wherefore, ſeeing that Chriſt and his Apoſtles, expound the firſt inſtitution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, of two onely, and not of any moe: it is certaine, that the contract or promiſe thereof, ought to be of two alone, and no moe. So the holy Ghoſt ſaying;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Let euery man haue his owne wife, &amp; euerie woman her owne husband:</hi> and not, let euery one haue his owne wiues, or owne husbands: it is therefore plaine and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe, that hee would haue a contract and marriage, to be onely betweene one and one. Againe, ſaying: <hi>his owne, and her owne,</hi> doth he not plainely inſinuate euery other perſon, and perſons, not to be their owne, but meere ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, with whom they ought to haue nothing adoe, in reſpect of marriage duties, eſpecially conſidering, that the Greeke word <hi>Idio,</hi> can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no leſſe. Now then, if there bee at any time, or in any place, a promiſe betweene moe then two, as it is a wicked and meere propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the holy ordinance of God: ſo it may and ought to be broken; yea, ſeuerely puniſhed by Parentes and Magiſtrates. If againſt this, it be obiected, that many of the Patriarches, and good men vnder the Law, had many wiues, or at leaſt moe then one: We anſwere, it was their ſecret ſinne, and great infirmitie, though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from ignorance of the firſt inſtitution, of marriage, of the Law and the holy Prophets (or elſe they had warrant from God, which we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8506:64"/> haue noted.) Of the inſtitution, becauſe Chriſt interpreting it,<note place="margin">Math. 19.8.</note> ſayth: <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo:</hi> proouing, that <hi>Moſes</hi> permitted diuorcement of the firſt wife, and marriage of the ſecond, not mooued or warranted by the authoritie of Gods inſtitution, but by a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and timerous conſideration of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the peoples hearts, whom hee ruled, leaſt they ſhould haue rebelled againſt him, if hee had not ſo done. Of the law, becauſe there was by this meanes, great iniurie done to Gods truth, and to the wiues diuorced: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the law it ſelfe well vnderſtood (as Chriſt expoundeth it, Math. 5.32.) admitteth no diuorcement, except it bee for fornication, and that the Lorde did diſallow and hate all other kindes of diuorcement, made without the cauſe of fornication:<note place="margin">Deut. 24.4.</note> it is euident,. in that hee condemneth the ſecond marriage, after the firſt diuorcement, affirming that the woman ſo diuorced, is defiled by her ſecond husband: which could not bee true, if their marriage had been lawfull and warrantable,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.4. Mal. 2.14.15.16.</note> by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, for where the marriage is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and honorable, there the bedde is vndefiled. Of the Prophets, becauſe the Lorde hath been witneſſe betweene thee and thy wife of thy youth, againſt whom thou haſt tranſgreſſed: yet is ſhe thy companion, and the wife of thy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and did not hee make one? yet had hee
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8506:64"/> aboundance of the ſpirit: and wherefore one? becauſe hee ſought a godly ſeede: therefore keepe your ſelues in your ſpirit, and let none treſpaſſe againſt the wife of his youth. If thou hateſt her, put her away (ſayth the Lorde of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell) yet hee couereth the iniurie vnder his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſayth the Lord of Hoſts) therefore keepe your ſelues in your ſpirit, and tranſgreſſe not. Then which wordes, what can be more plainely ſpoken againſt this ſinne of hauing moe wiues then one? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For doth not the Prophet plainely ſay, that God is witneſſe, that they haue tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt the wife of their youth &amp; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doth he not cal them to the firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when God made but one, &amp; that becauſe he would haue a godly ſeede, and not an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generation? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doth he not further ſay, that in putting away the wife, they did nothing elſe, but couer iniurie, vnder pretence of his law, as with a garment? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And finally, doth he not giue a clean contrarie commaundement, to that wicked cuſtome of diuorcement, and marrying of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? when he ſaith: keepe your ſelues in your ſpirit, and let none tranſgreſſe againſt the wife of his youth, and of his couenant? Surely none can bee ſo blinde, but reading this portion of ſcripture, hee muſt needs plainly ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame. Wherefore, if the firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred inſtstution of God, do bewary this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hauing moe wiues then one: If the law
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8506:65"/> doe condemne it, and if the Prophets doe ſo ſharply cenſure and rebuke it? Why ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bee ſo impudent and wicked, as to iuſtifie it in word, or to approue it in thought? Rather as here we teach, let vs iudge and beleeue, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie lawfull Contract and mariage, ought to be onely betweene one man, and one woman. And the reſt to bee ſo many breaches of Gods ordinances and commaundements, which can not be but hateful to him, and iniurious to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: but eſpecially to the Church of God, which ought to ariſe of a holie and godly ſeed. Now if any Contract be made betweene moe then two, it is altogether voide, and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ought to be broken by the parties, and puniſhed by the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>The ſixt point, concerneth the perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom the Contract is made, in whom there is required two properties: meetneſſe for mariage, and freedome or libertie to marry one another. Touching the firſt, thoſe eſpecially are fit and meete to marrie, whom God doth call to that honourable eſtate, and commaundeth them to vſe it as his lawfull meanes, appointed and ſanctified for procreation: for ſo it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the firſt inſtitution, wherein God gaue the woman to the man to bee an helper meet for him, as in other things, ſo eſpecially in this: whom he bleſſed,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.20.22. and 1.28.</note> ſaying: <hi>Bring foorth fruite and multiplie, &amp;c.</hi> And that wee may know
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8506:65"/> more particularly what ſort of perſons they be, the holy Ghoſt deſcribeth them to bee ſuch, as to whom the gift of continencie is denied, yet the gift of procreation is vouchſafed and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For if mariage (as the Apoſtle ſaith, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes. 13. verſ. 4.) bee honorable among all ſorts of perſons,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.8.9.</note> then amongſt thoſe that bee ſtrong. Againe, it is written: <hi>I ſay to the vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and to widowes, it is good for them if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide euen as I doe: but if they cannot abstaine, let them marrie: for it is better to marrie, then to burne.</hi> In which words wee may plainly ſee, that hee pointeth out, as with his finger, thoſe that are called and commaunded by God to marrie: namely, ſuch as haue not receiued the gift of abſtinence and continencie, which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is ſo much the ſtraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the more to be regarded and followed, becauſe the Apoſtle gaue it to thoſe perſons that were moleſted, and preſſed with many and grieuous perſecutions (a ſeaſon of all other moſt vnfit for any to marrie in.) In as much, as beſide the ordinarie incommodities of mariage eſtate, it cannot but bring with it many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie grieuances and troubles. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if ſuch perſons bee called and commaunded then to marrie, when as there was moſt grieuous perſecutions, much more in the time of peace and proſperitie. By this then wee ſee, that all perſons which haue not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8506:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> receiued the gift of abſtinence, but of procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are called and commanded to marrie, and therefore meete for mariage, and alſo may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enter a contract of the ſame.</p>
               <p>But are none elſe meete for mariage? Wee anſwere, that no other is called, commaunded, or warranted by God, to make contract with any of theſe meet ones, becauſe they are vnable to performe the principall duties of marriage. As for children vnder age, they are altogether vnfit to take vpon them this honourable eſtate, and therefore debarred by Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from making any promiſe or contract: if they haue, it is but a meere prophanation of this holy ordinance, worthie great puniſhment, and alſo to bee broken, if that being come to yeares of diſcretion, and ſtate of mariage, they doe not by wiſedome and religion, ſupply all that was wanting in their former raſh atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, to the full co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation of al that haue intereſt in them. As for thoſe that haue receiued the gift of continencie, they are called and counſelled to chaſtitie, during the whole time of that gift: for ſo ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt (<hi>All men cannot receiue this thing, ſaue they to whom it is giuen,</hi> Matth. 19.12.) And againe, he that is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this, let him receiue it. So the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is good for them if they abide euen as I doe,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.7. Againe, <hi>Art thou looſed from a wife, ſeeke not a wife:</hi> So likewiſe are thoſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8506:66"/> that are borne chaſte, or made chaſte by men, or by themſelues for the kingdome of heauen. But you will ſay, what if any of theſe doe make a contract, and marrie? We anſwere firſt if they bee vtterly vnfit for marriage with one that is meete, their contract is of no validitie, and may bee broken by ſuperiour authoritie:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.27.</note> but if they both bee fit for marriage, wee ſay with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Art thou looſed from a wife, ſeeke not a wife? but if thou takeſt a wife, thou ſinneſt not: and if a virgin marrie, ſhe ſinneth not, &amp;c. Laſt of all, as conſanguinitie and affinitie doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine and binde from this former contract and mariage: ſo likewiſe doe naturall frigiditie and coldnes, infancie, incurable diſeaſes, that depriue men of all fitnes for the vſe of mariage. So as if any ſuch, by fraud, ignorance, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſiniſter means be contracted it is nothing, and the parties may be lawfully ſeparated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were neuer ioyned together in the Lord, but againſt the Lord. And here when wee ſay, meete and free to marrie one with an other, there would bee a wiſe and holie regard had of the qualitie in yeares, of agreement in religion, of ſimilitude in nature, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in outward eſtate, condition and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of perſon, and ſuch like neceſſarie cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. For what is more vnmeete, then for an olde perſon to promiſe to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to a young one? for an Infidell to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8506:67"/> contract with a beleeuer? for a good nature and well mannered, with a crooked and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perſon? for a Prince with a begger? For although all theſe doe not annihilate and make voide the contract altogether, yet ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts cannot bee in the Lord. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to haue taught, touching the fitnes of mariage.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the freedome and libertie, it is cleere, that thoſe alone haue libertie and freedome to contract, who haue liberty to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Now if we will know who thoſe be, they are diuerſly deſcribed and noted in Leuit 18. where certaine degrees, aſwell in affinitie, as in conſanguinitie, are expreſly forbidden: ſo that if ſuch parties ſhall contract themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their contract is vaine, and a meere nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſuch as ought to bee broken and puniſhed. Againe, euery one either betrothed or married, is bounden and tied from contracting with any other: for that were nothing elſe but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe groſſe and beaſtly adulterie. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth, that the wife is bound by the law, as long as her husband liueth, ſo likewiſe is the betrothed wife: inſomuch, as if any of theſe ſhall contract themſelues with another, it is a meere nullitie, and wicked prophanation of Gods ordinance, and ought vpon knowledge thereof, to be broken and puniſhed. And thus wee ſee what maner of perſons the Lord hath
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8506:67"/> called and commaunded to marrie, and who they be that are meete and free to marrie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and who not.</p>
               <p>The laſt point, is the conſent and allowance of their Parents; which though it be very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and neceſſarie, yet it is not the ſole forme or formall cauſe which maketh a true contract. For if the parents ſhould yeeld their conſent to their children, being neither meete nor free to be maried together, it were nothing, and ſuch a contract, though warranted by parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ought to bee broken by the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and the Magiſtrate, and both parents and children puniſhed. For this cauſe we haue not ſayd ſimply and allowed, but allowed ſo to doe, becauſe that conſent of parents to ſuch children as are meete and fit to bee maried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, doth not only make that contract good, true, and inuiolable: which wanting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, though in other reſpects neuer ſo good, is a meere nullitie, and cannot be accompliſhed without the manifeſt breaches of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and guilt of adulterie.</p>
               <p>Now by Parents, we vnderſtand not onelie the naturall Parents, but ſuch as by the law of nature and of GOD, ſupply their places: as Grandfathers, great Grandfathers, Aunts, great Vncles and Aunts, Brethren, Siſters, Kinſmen, and Kinſwomen, Magiſtrates, and thoſe to whoſe families the parties doe eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8506:68"/> For all theſe are honoured in Scripture by the name of Parents. Neither may wee exempt out of this number, Gardians, Maſters, and ſuch to whom the continuall cuſtodie and tuition of any, is lawfully committed. For if ſuch bee commanded to prouide for them, as parties of their owne families; there is no reaſon why they ſhould not eſpecially bee reſpected, aſwell in beſtowing them abroad out of their familie, as they were in taking them into it: for if their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent bee neceſſarie at their comming in, why ſhould they goe out without their conſent?</p>
               <p>Further wee ſay, their parents, and not his, or her parents, becauſe pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts on both ſides, ought neceſſarily to conſent &amp; allow their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to betroth themſelues. For this is the priuiledge, not of ſome parents, but of all, and in that they be parents. Moreouer we ſay, allowed, and not required, neither commaunded, nor yet exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or inducted ſo to doe: becauſe that albeit the parents doe neither call their children to this contract, neither commaund them, neither require them, neither exhort them (all which notwithſtanding they ought to doe) yet if they doe but onely allow them, and giue their bare conſent that they ſhall contract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; it is enough for the tying of the knot, and the ſubſtance of the contract. And to prooue that this contract is neceſſarie, we need no moe reaſons, then that which the Apoſtle ſetteth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8506:68"/> downe, ſaying of the father:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Let him doe what he will:</hi> by which words, hee putteth it in the will and power of his parents, whether to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or not to marrie: ſaying, in doing either of the twaine, he ſinneth not. Yet it is written in another place:<note place="margin">Exod. 22.16.17</note> 
                  <hi>If her father refuſe to giue her to him, he ſhall pay money according to the dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of virgins.</hi> In which words, the Lord doth giue an abſolute authoritie to the father, to yeeld, or not to yeeld his conſent, to giue, or not to giue his daughter: for if hee haue power to deny it to his daughter, that is deflowred, and ſo by the Apoſtles iudgement, made one fleſh with another; much more lawfully may he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie his conſent to her that is no maner of way bound, but is euery way free.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.16.</note> And if hee haue power to denie his conſent in ſuch a caſe, much more hath he power to giue his conſent.</p>
               <p>Now his authoritie and power to denie his conſent, is apparant by the expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God in that behalfe, which ſayth: <hi>Take heede to thy ſelfe,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Deut. 7.3.</note> 
                  <hi>neither giue thy daughter vnto his ſon, nor take his daughter to thy ſon.</hi> How could thoſe parents obſerue this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnleſſe God had giuen them power to deny conſent to their children? Or why doth he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8506:69"/> rather forbidde this to the parents; then to the children, but to ſhew that the power to giue, or not to giue, was in the parents, and not in the children: eſpecially conſidering that children being the principall partes of their parents goods, are no leſſe in their power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to giue and beſtow, then the reſt are. This was ſo well knowne in the Church, and ſo vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally practiſed among the people of God, that the greateſt among them, who might ſeeme to haue greateſt libertie in that behalfe, yet they durſt not diſobey this holie commandement of GOD.<note place="margin">Iudg. 15.</note> For <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the ſtrongeſt of all, though he loued a maide of the Philiſtines, yet he durſt not betroth himſelfe vnto her, before he had intreated his parents to giue her vnto him. <hi>Dauid</hi> a mightie valiant prince, begged <hi>Micholl</hi> at the hands of <hi>Saul</hi> her father, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death being betrothed vnto him, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her of <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> her brother. <hi>Iacob</hi> agreed with <hi>Laban</hi> for his wiues.<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8506:69"/> vnder heauen. For here in this that ſaying of Chriſt, (Matth. 19.6.) is trulie verified: <hi>Let no man put aſunder that which God hath coupled together.</hi> But if this, or any of the former bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Contract may bee broken and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled. And leaſt wee ſhould bee ignorant, or forget what thoſe errours are, which diſauow and lawfully fruſtrate a Contract, theſe they bee. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, if there bee onely a naked ſhew of a promiſe, and yet no promiſe indeede.

Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> if there lacke the conſent of the parents. If all or any of theſe bee vndoubtedly knowne, and cleerely proued, they doe ioyntly and ſeuerallie fruſtrate or nullifie the Contract, ſo as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may lawfully diſſolue the ſame, and ſet the parties at libertie. But contrarily, if all theſe concurre and accord, the contract is as inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable as mariage it ſelfe: neither can the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8506:70"/> bee ſet at libertie by themſelues, or by any power whatſoeuer, becauſe this contract, and euery parcell thereof is in the Lord. It being a ſacred ordinance of God, as it cannot but haue ſpeciall vſe and fruite among his Saints: ſo now it is time to declare and teach the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt therefore, it ſerueth as a ſtrong bridle to pull backe the force and headines of carnall, naturall, and brutiſh luſt: for if this contract be holily and dutifully kept, according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrine, it would neuer come to paſſe, that any perſon, man or woman, ſhould abuſe their bodies ſuddenly, or haſtily vpon euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of luſt, like brute beaſts, but would willingly in all modeſtie and ſobrietie, take ſufficient time of deliberation, for the making and accompliſhing of this neceſſarie and holie contract, which is ordained to this ende, that men might haue ſufficient time of deliberation, to learne all the vſes and abuſes; all commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and incommodities; all comforts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts, with all duties &amp; breaches of duties, that can fall into the honourable eſtate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it ſerueth to diſcouer betimes, and in good ſeaſon, all ſorts of impediments &amp; lets, that may or ought to hinder the mariage that is promiſed. Hence came that ancient and moſt excellent cuſtome of asking the banes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8506:70"/> thrice on three ſeueral daies, to the end that euery materiall defect might be learned in time when it might bee remedied, then after mariage accompliſhed, when it is remedileſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it ſerueth for the keeping and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of honeſt chaſtitie, ſeeing by this meanes, not onely former promiſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, but alſo fornications (if any haue been) and adulteries, may bee deſcried and diſcerned. For after <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was contracted before they were married, ſhe was found to be with childe; (though without ill demeanour on her part) yet it made <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo afraid, that he had intended in his heart priuatly to relinquiſh and forſake her, and had ſo done indeede, vnleſſe Gods Angell had commanded the contrarie. Neuertheleſſe, it was the Contract that diſcouered this trueth, &amp; ſo preſerued <hi>Maries</hi> virginity, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might bee fulfilled, which ſaith: <hi>A virgin ſhall conceiue, &amp;c.</hi> If this were not, men might vpon knowledge or ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, make two ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall contracts with ſeuerall perſons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication and adulterie with other mens wiues, either betrothed or married, and ſo loſe their honeſtie and chaſtitie, to their great infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie &amp; hinderance. Laſt of all, it ſerueth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and auoide all priuate contracts, and ſecret mariages, and contrarily, to iuſtifie and grace the honourable eſtate of mariage, aſwell in the beginning, as in the end thereof, that all
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8506:71"/> things touching the ſame might bee begunne, continued and finiſhed in the Lord, according to his commandement, that his promiſed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings might enſue vpon it accordingly.</p>
               <p>This being done, the parents and parties are to be charged in the name of God, as they will anſwere at the day of iudgement, plainly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray and declare, if they know any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid impediments in themſelues, or in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which this Contract ought not to bee made. If they ſay, they know none, or if they declare none, then the conſent of the parents is to be demaunded: which if they yeeld, then the conſent of the parties is alſo to bee required. And ſo the parties are to be betrothed and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anced in theſe words, or ſuch like.</p>
               <q>I. N. doe willingly promiſe to marrie thee N. if God will, and I liue, whenſoeuer our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhall thinke good and meet: till which time, I take thee for my only betrothed wife, and thereto plight thee my troth. In the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt: So be it.</q>
               <p>The ſame is to bee done by the woman, the name onely changed, and all in the preſence of the parents, kinsfolkes and friends. After this, the parents are to bee admoniſhed, to ſet and appoint the day of mariage neither too neere,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8506:71"/> nor too farre off, but to appoint a competent ſpace of time, that it may bee ſufficient for the learning and triall of all lets and impediments, whereby promiſed mariage might bee hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and yet giue no occaſion, by reaſon of the length thereof, to prouoke the parties to incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie. In the meane time, the parties affian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced are to be admoniſhed to abſtaine from the vſe of mariage, and to behaue themſelues wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, chaſtly, louingly, and ſoberly, till the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed doe come. And ſo with a Pſalme and prayer, to conclude the holy action.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe there might be ſome preparation for the things pertaining to houſekeeping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that time, and the celebrating of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: but this is not a chiefe cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Lord would by this meanes make a difference betwixt brute beaſts and men, and betwixt the prophane and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For they euen as beaſts, doe after a beaſt-like maner, being led by a naturall inſtinct and motion, fall together: but God will haue this difference, whereby his children ſhould bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from that brutiſh manner, in that they ſhould haue a certaine diſtance of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the knitting of affection, and enioying one of another, and a more neere ioyning of one vnto another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they ſhould in that time thinke on the cauſes why they are to marrie, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8506:72"/> of mariage: for many enter thereinto, not conſidering at all of the great duties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them in the ſame, nor thinke of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and afflictions that follow mariage. But the Lord would haue theſe things thought on, and a conſideration to be had, both of the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of mariage, and the duties to be performed, and the troubles to be vndergone. A good and carefull houſeholder ſo ordereth and frameth his houſehold, ſo as it may manifeſtly appeare, that it is indeede the houſe of a faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and that he himſelfe is as a paſtour ouer his familie, that hee inſtructeth it diligently in the feare of GOD, and keepeth it in good and godly diſcipline, by continuall exerciſe in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. So that in his houſe, you ſhall finde the chaſte wife, the ſhamefaced, plaine and modeſt wife, decked without, as ſhe is within; no pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nor masked thing, rendring true obedience to her husband, and hauing a carefull eye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her familie, ſeruants, her children: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, father, and husband: the children and ſeruants, euerie one likewiſe in his degree, imploying himſelfe ſincerely in his dutie and office, approouing his dooings as before God.</p>

               <p>For by how much the greater and ſtraighter the coniunction is of the husband &amp; the wife; ſo much the more ought euery one prouide to be indifferently matched:<note place="margin">Equalitie in marriage to be reſpected.</note> and truely this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of marriage, is in two ſpeciall things to be conſidered: to wit, eſtate, and age.

And ſhe ought to conſider, that no diſtinction or difference of birth and nobilitie can be ſo great, but that the league, which both Gods ordinance &amp; nature, hath ordained betwixt men and women, farre exceedeth it: for by nature woman was made mans ſubiect. But if a man ſhall take to wife an inferiour or meane woman, he alſo ought to weigh, that Matrimonie maketh equall many differences: and further, that he hath not taken her for a ſlaue or ſeruaunt, but for a fellow and companion of his life.<note place="margin">Of the choiſe of a wife.</note> And ſeeing that electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or choiſe, is nothing elſe, but to take a thing meete and conuenient to the end it is prepared for, therefore euery one that muſt chuſe, ought to regard the ende, and to know what thing is conuenient for it. So that it is needefull, that he be wiſe and diſcreet, or elſe hee cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, nor perceiue what thing is conuenient for it. Therefore, if a man would aduiſedly conſider, that he is to liue with his wife conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and ſhe with him, he would then be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſpect in the choiſe of her, which choiſe, maketh either very much for his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and comforte, or elſe for his great miſerie

               <p>And therefore it ſeemeth leſſe to ſome, to be driuen out of his kingdome then to other ſome to looſe a ſmal portion of his poſſeſſions.

If thou goe from home, thou doeſt commit thy houſe, thy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, thy goods, and thy children (of all other thinges the moſt pleaſant) vnto her: ſhee is the laſt that leaueth thee at thy departing, and the firſt that receiueth thee at thy returning: thou departeſt from her with ſweete imbracements and kiſſes, and with ſweete kiſſes and imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe receiueth thee at thy returne home: vnto her thou diſcloſeſt thy ioy &amp; heauines. So that it is an heauenly life to be conuerſant, and in the company with thoſe that a man deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in and loueth. But it is a calamitie infernal, to be bound and forced to ſee thoſe things that a man doth greatly hate &amp; abhorre, or to be in company with thoſe that a man would not be withall, and yet cannot bee ſeparated nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them. Hereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, as we doe ſee in ſome mariages, ſo great ruines, ſo wicked and vile deeds, as maimes, &amp; murders commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch deſperate perſons, as are loth to keepe, and yet cannot lawfully refuſe, nor
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8506:77"/> leaue them: Therefore young folkes ought not to be too raſh and haſtie in their choiſe, but to haue the good aduiſe and direction of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and truſtie friendes in this behalfe, who haue better iudgement, and are mote free from the motions of all affections, then they are. And they muſt take heede, leaſt following the light and corrupt iudgement of their owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and mindes, they change not a ſhort delectation and pleaſure, into a continuall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance. For wee doe learne, by great and continuall vſe and experience of thinges, that the ſecret contractes made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thoſe that be young doe ſeldome proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whereas contrariwiſe, thoſe marriages that are made and ſtabliſhed by the aduiſe of wiſe and religious parents, doe proſper well.</p>
               <p>But ſpecially and before all thinges, ſuch as purpoſe to marrie, muſt faithfully with feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſtedfaſt beleefe, (without ceaſing) make their interceſſion and prayer vnto God,<note place="margin">A good wife is aboue all things to be craued of God by prayer.</note> to whom all hearts are open and knowne, that hee would not ſuffer them to goe amiſſe, but (as a tender father) helpe and direct them to make a right choiſe, ſo as they may liue honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and proſperouſly, as good chriſtians ought, to his glorie, and their owne comfort. For this purpoſe, there is a notable example of <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, Abraham's</hi> ſeruant, who being ſent to get and make choiſe of a wife for <hi>Iſaac</hi> his maſters
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8506:77"/> ſonne, beginneth his matter with prayer: Gen. 24.12. &amp;c. So did <hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo, as appeareth in the ſame Chapter, verſe 63. When any haue determined with themſelues to marrie, and haue vſed all diligence thereto required, rhey muſt deſire of God by humble and earneſt prayer, good and proſperous ſucceſſe, in whoſe hand and power it is to giue it, and doubtleſſe he will effect it, if they aboue all other thinges, ſhall haue an vndoubted hope and confidence in him. For if they, after that they haue ſettled themſelues, and haue ſatisfied their appetites, ſhall then reſort vnto God by prayer, deſiring him that they may obtaine the thing that they moſt deſire, ſo it would appeare, that they would make him the Miniſter of their volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous deſires and pleaſures, and ſo doing, their vowes and prayers ſhould become moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt blaſphemie. And therefore a man ſhould not come vnto marriage, as vnto a prophane thing, with a looſe and vnprepared minde, but with a quiet &amp; wel purged minde, as to a thing moſt ſacred &amp; holy. For Matrimonie doth not conſiſt onely in the coniunction of the bodie, neither yet in dauncing, nor banquetting (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and brought vnto vs, with many other things from the Gentiles) but it ſhould rather beſeeme chriſtians, moſt ſtudiouſly to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that ſo weighty a thing as matrimony is, might haue good and proſperous ſucceſſe.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8506:78"/> For Matrimony is a thing ſanctified of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> the which willeth the matrimoniall imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be chaſt, the bed to be vndefiled, and their progeny vnſpotted: &amp; it is after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.25.26, 27.</note> a ſigne of the great myſtery, wherewith Chriſt doth indiſſolubly vnite himſelfe vnto his Church. Therefore thou oughteſt, ſo much as ſhall lie in thee, to lift vp thy mind, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how great and worthy an image thou doeſt repreſent, and that thy wife ſhall be vnto thee, as the Church, and thou vnto her as Chriſt: therfore thou ſhouldeſt ſhew thy ſelfe vnto her, as Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe vnto his church. The loue of Chriſt vnto his church is incredible, and thy loue alſo to thy wife ought to be moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, Societie, and to liue togither, is the moſt ſureſt and ſtrongeſt knot, to knit &amp; ioyne ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; loue among men, &amp; al other beaſts. There can be no greater ſocietie or companie, then is between a man &amp; his wife: whoſe houſe, whoſe goods, whoſe chamber, &amp;c. is common, their children are common, &amp; they themſelues par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of all good &amp; euill ſucceſſe, of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and aduerſity: the which ſocietie and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, were ſufficient to ſtir &amp; prouoke him that loueth not his wife, to loue and beneuolence. And what company or loue ſhall a man looke to haue of him that loueth not his wife? There are, that in loue and amitie looke for gaine, as the vile Epicures do, vnworthy to be beloued,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8506:78"/> men which loue themſelues, &amp; not their friends. And if we haue a regard vnto commoditie and profit, there is nothing that giueth ſo much as doth a good wife, no not horſes, oxen, ſeruants or farmers: for a mans wife is the fellowe and comforter of all cares and thoughts, and doth more faithfull and true ſeruice vnto him, then either maid-ſeruant or man-ſeruant, the which doe ſerue men for feare, or elſe for wages: but thy wife will be ledde onely by loue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee doth euery thing better then all other. And this doth God declare, ſaying: <hi>Let vs make Adam a helper like vnto himſelfe:</hi> By the <hi>Helper,</hi> is ſignified the vtilitie and profit of the ſeruice, and by the ſimilitude and likeneſſe, is ſignified loue. For a ſeruant and hee that is hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are farre vnlike the maſter, and are taken well nigh for no men. A ſeruaunt in the ſtead and place of an horſe, or of an oxe, the which muſt bee beaten and inforced to their worke, doth ſerue his maſter. A hired ſeruant, is in the place of an hired horſe, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hire is paid, the ſocietie &amp; fellowſhip diſſolueth. The child is part of the father, and through a naturall pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they loue each other: but yet the wife is more annexed and ioyned to her husband. The father doth labour and taketh paine for his children, but the childten ſeldome labour or take paynes for their fathers, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are ſent to inhabite and dwell in other
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8506:79"/> mens houſes, whereby in a manner it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that their ſtraight and faſt ſocietie doth diſſolue and breake. But the wife cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, doth continually take paines for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who may neither (as long as ſhe liueth) change houſe nor bed. If commoditie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit be looked for, no commoditie excelleth this: if thou ſhalt loue thy wife, thou ſhalt liue moſt pleaſantly, if not, thy life will be moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; wretched. For there is nothing ſo ſharpe nor ſo bitter, as to hate the thing that doth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and loue thee, nor nothing more happy, as to loue him that hateth thee. Therefore loue, that thou mayeſt be loued.</p>
               <p>Now we will in few words ſhew the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wedlocke, why and wherefore it was ordeyned, and for what purpoſe it ſhould bee contracted, that euery man and woman may the better vnderſtand to what thing they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when eyther of them graunteth to marrie the other.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe it cannot otherwiſe be, but that marriage, which was ordeined of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent author, as of GOD himſelfe, &amp; in ſuch a worthy place, as Paradiſe; and of ſuch an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time, as in the ſtate of <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Eues</hi> innocencie, and after ſuch a notable order, but that it muſt likewiſe haue ſpeciall cauſes, for the ordinance of it. Therefore the holy Scripture doth declare chiefely three cauſes thereof.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8506:79"/> The firſt is, the procreation, begetting,<note place="margin">Three cauſes of marriage.</note> &amp; brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp of children: Gen. 1.27, 28. &amp; 9.1. For in the children do the parents liue, (after a ſort) euen after death.</p>
               <p>And, if they be well and vertuouſly brought vp, God is greatly honoured by them, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth is aduanced: yea, their parents and all other fare the better for them. For they are their parents comfort next vnto God: their ioy, ſtaffe, and vpholding of their age: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Parents ought to beginne betimes, to plant vertue in their childrens breaſtes: for late ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, bringeth a late, or neuer, an apt harueſt: young branches will bow as a man will haue them: But olde trees will ſooner breake then bow, &amp;c. But more of this ſhall be ſaid after, in the dutie of parents.</p>
               <p>Although mariage be a holy and ſanctified ordinance, yet none may vſe the benefite of it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> without ſome acknowledgement of originall ſinne, in that adulterie and whoredome are wrought by this meanes: albeit this is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the children of God, who vſe this meanes with as much chaſtitie as may be, and ſo long as the husband and wife do keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues togither in the feare of God, and in all modeſtie and ſobrietie.</p>
               <p>If then in mariage it ſelfe, there is ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, what helliſh miſchiefe is there in thoſe luſtes, which are not ſanctified without theſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8506:80"/> conſiderations? So that marriage is not a mad and diſſolute eſtate, neither are husbandes to turne their wiues into whores, or wiues their husbands into whoremaſters, by immoderate, intemperate, or exceſſiue luſt.</p>
               <p>Many thinke they cannot ſinne in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, if they paſſe not their owne wiues: but they may make their marriage polluted &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, if they vſe it without prayer and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: &amp;c. 1. Theſſ 4.4.5.</p>
               <p>Therefore the husband is to forbeare the company of his wife, when it is with her, as it is common to women: &amp;c. Ezechiel 18.6. Leuiticus 18.19.24.27.29. and 29.18. This was one of the ſinnes, for which the Lord roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the Cananites out of their land.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The 1. cauſe.</note>The ſecond occaſion why Marriage was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, was, that the wife might bee a lawfull remedie to auoid whoredome,<note place="margin">Wedlocke lawfull for ſuch as haue not the gift of chaſtitie.</note> fornication, and all filthie vncleane luſts. 1.

               <p>Moſt true it is, that women are as men are, reaſonable creatures, and haue flexible wittes, both to good and euill, the which with vſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and good counſell, may be altered and turned. And although there be ſome euill and lewde women, yet that doth no more prooue the malice of their nature, then of men, and therefore the more ridiculous and fooliſh are they, that haue inueighed againſt the whole ſexe for a few euill: and haue not with like furie, vituperated and diſpraiſed all mankind, becauſe part of them are theeues, murtherers, and ſuch like wicked liuers.</p>
               <p>But the marriage and company of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, is made amiable, ſweete, and comfortable, by theſe fiue meanes: by godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vertue, mutuall forbearing, mutuall loue, and by dutifulneſſe performed buſily and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on both ſides.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Godlineſſe of right, holdeth the chiefe place.

               <p n="4">4. Mutuall loue, hauing his beginning of godlineſſe and true vertue, maketh the husband and wife not to be too ſharpe ſighted in ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into one anothers faults: but that many things either they marke not, or if they marke them, they couer them with loue. For <hi>Loue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the multitude of ſinnes.</hi> 1. Pet. 4.8. Prou. 10.12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Dutie performed godlily, carefully, and cheerfully on both ſides, maketh the mariage-yoke light and ſweete. For when man and wife marke one another, and finde like heedfulneſſe and buxamnes in their dutie; both their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie is made more pleaſant, and they are the more ſtirred vp on both ſides to render dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that the one may requite the other alike. Where theſe fiue duties bee not, the companie of their life is both lothſome and bitter, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſharpe then death.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8506:82"/> points contained in this dutie, and mentioned in the beginning hereof, and ſo end this dutie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt whereof is, That the husband muſt liue with his wife according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. This point of doctrine is moſt plainlie proued by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>Ye huſbands dwell with your wiues,</hi>

                  </gap> ſhe is not therefore to bee neglected becauſe ſhee is weake, but on the contrarie part, ſhee ought to be ſo much the more cared for. Like as a veſſell the weaker it is, the more it is to bee fauoured and ſpared, if we will haue it to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: euen ſo a wife, becauſe of her infirmities, is ſo much the more to be borne withall of her husband. 1. Pet. 3.7. And for ſo much as the husband and wife are equall, in that which is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:8506:82"/> the chiefeſt, that is to ſay, if that gracious and free benefit, whereby they haue euerlaſting life giuen them, which otherwiſe are vnequall, as touching the gouernance and conuerſation at home, and therefore ſhe is not to bee deſpiſed, although ſhe be weake. And beſides,<note place="margin">Beſides the praiers had with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, they muſt pray pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately. Gene. 25.21. 1.

Defraude not one another, except it bee with conſent for a time, that yee may giue your ſelues to fasting and prayer, and againe come together, that Sathan tempt you not for your incontinencie.</hi> VVhich is, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, The parties married, muſt with ſingular affection, entirelie loue one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that they are each in others power, as touching the bodie: ſo that they may not defraud one another, except the one abſtaine from the other by mutuall conſent that they may the better giue themſelues to prayer: wherein notwithſtanding, they muſt conſider

And when he doth thinke himſelfe to bee the head and the ſoule, and the woman (as it were) the fleſh and the bodie, hee ought in like maner to remember, that ſhe is his fellow and companion of his

And thus there ſhall bee in wedlocke a certaine ſweete and pleaſant conuerſation, without the which it is no mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but a priſon, a hatred, and a perpetuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the minde. So that the husband muſt let his wife perceiue and know, that for the good opinion that he hath of her, he doth loue her ſimply, and faithfully, and not for any vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or pleaſure.

So that the dutie of the husband and the wife, conſiſteth in this, that they liue together in all chaſtitie and pureneſſe, and that they take great heed, and beware of breaking the bond, and infringing, and violating the faith of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by fornication or adulterie, which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable ſinne, in the ſight both of GOD and man.

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultrie.</hi> For the word adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, comprehendeth al prouocations, geſtures, ſpeeches: yea, euen vnchaſt lookes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayth Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Math. 5.18.</note> 
                  <hi>He that looketh vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans wife, to luſt after her, hath alreadie committed adultrie with her in his heart.</hi> Next, that we may preuent all occaſions of ielouſie, a moſt dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous diſeaſe, &amp; of great difficulty to cure. For where either the husband or the wife,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8506:94"/> is tainted with ielouſie, they beleeue euery word that they heare ſpoken touching their paſſion, albeit it beare no apparance of trueth. And therefore chriſtian husbands and wiues, muſt ſo beare themſelues, that they incurre no ſuſpition of euill. But rather they ought to practiſe this, as well to auoide occaſion of offence, as for feare, leaſt iealouſie ſhould conuert marriage into a moſt miſerable and wretched eſtate.</p>
               <p>The care and burthen to maintaine their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie is common to them both: yet ſo, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the husband is to get it, and to bring it in, and the wife to order and diſpoſe it. Howbeit the dutie of the wife, or of the husband, doth not ſo exempt either of them, but that ſhe alſo according to her ability and power, muſt helpe her husband to get it, and hee likewiſe in his diſcretion, direct her in the diſpenſation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.<note place="margin">Exod. 20.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that doth not orderly gouern his houſe, ſhall inherit the winde</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi>) And or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſiſteth in this, that the husband follow his buſineſſe, trafique, or calling, without any moleſtation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wife, who ought not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or controle him therein, but with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and gentelneſſe, as alſo the husband is not to deale, but ſoberly and in great diſcretion with affaires, that are proper to the wife. The man is iealous of his authoritie and reputation, and the woman inclined to ſuſpect her ſelfe to be deſpiſed. Wherefore, as the husband cannot
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8506:94"/> well abide, that his wife ſhoud ſhew her ſelfe more skilfull and wiſe in his buſineſſe then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: ſo cannot the wife ſuffer, that her husband ſhould deſpiſe and account her a foole, by med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with her ſmall houſehold affaires.</p>
               <p>As the dutie therefore of the husband and wife, conſiſteth in looking to that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, to the end their mariage may be quiet, and themſelues liue together in loue: euen ſo an idle and vnthrifty husband, and a prodigall and ſlothfull wife, are two ready waies to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The husband that hath ſuch a wife, caſteth his labours into a bottomleſſe ſacke: and the wife that is matched with ſuch a husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Carte heauie loden, through a ſandy way without a horſe.</p>
               <p>Such a husband, eſpecially, if idleneſſe drawe him to loue and haunt Ale-houſes and tauernes, is cruel to his wife and children: and ſuch a wife confoundeth her husband, &amp; bringeth reproch and pouertie to her whole familie. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for the husband, that hath ſuch a wife is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, with diſcreet admonition and praier to God: as alſo the helpe for the wife that hath ſuch a husband, is tolleration, gentle exhortation, and chearfull and louing entertainment of her husband, whereby to induce him willingly to keepe home.</p>
               <p>They are alſo to be mutual helpers, each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in matters concerning their own ſaluation,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8506:95"/> and the ſeruice of God. Firſt if one of them (as ſaith the Apoſtle) bee an vnbeleeuer, the other muſt labour to drawe his partie to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting the husband and wife, of contrary religions, not to part, but to dwel together addeth a notable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaying: <hi>What knoweſt thou ô man, whether thou ſhalt ſaue thy wife:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.16.</note> 
                  <hi>or thou ô woman, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt ſaue thy husband?</hi> Therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that the faithfull perſon, in dutie is to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and indeuour to winne his partie to the knowledge of the trueth, and ſo to ſaue her.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth wiues to bee ſubiect to their husbands, albeit vnbeleeuers, and ſuch as not obey the word, that ſo without ſpeech, <hi>By their holy and vertuous conuerſation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>they may winne them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if both be beleeuers, their dutie is, to confirme and ſtrengthen each other, in the time of perſecution, that they conſtantly follow Ieſus Chriſt. They are alſo each to helpe and comfort other, if eyther of them happen to fall into any fault or ſinne. They ought alſo each to perſwade other to charitie, to relieue the poore, diligently to frequent ſermons, to vſe praiers and ſupplications, and praiſe and thankſgiuings to the Lorde, to comfort each other in the time of afflictions, to be ſhort either to exhort other, to walke in the feare of God, and in all duties and exerciſes beſeeming
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8506:95"/> the children of God.<note place="margin">2. King. 4.10.</note> In this manner did that holy woman <hi>Elizeus</hi> Hoſteſſe exhort her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to prepare a chamber for the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ophet to lodge in. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.35.</note> that women de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to learne, ſhould queſtion with their husbands at home. Whereby he ſheweth, that the husband ought to bee ſo inſtructed, as hee may be ready to inſtruct his wife at home. And therefore the husband (after the example of the Bee) ſhould euerie where gather euerie good inſtruction, that he might bee able to impart it to his wife, and by hauing communication, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her therewith.</p>
               <p>There are other duties, which bee common both to the husband and the wife, as among the reſt, ſuch as proceed of the vnion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of marriage, whereof it is ſaid, <hi>They are one fleſh:</hi> Geneſ. 2.24. Math. 19.5. And of this vnion, proceedeth the mutual loue betwixt them. <hi>For no man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hateth his owne fleſh, but loueth and cheriſheth it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.15. Titus. 24.</note> But for as much as the foundation of this mutuall loue, is the vnitie of marriage, wherby the husband and the wife, are made one fleſh the husband as the head, the wife as the body.</p>
               <p>It followeth, that this loue muſt be ſtedfaſt, not variable, and that the vnion of marriage continue, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer befall, either the husband or the wife. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whatſoeuer complexions (wee ſay) natures
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8506:96"/> and infirmities may appeare, whatſoeuer ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, loſſe of goods, iniuries, griefes, or other inconueniences that may ariſe, yet ſo long as the foundation of loue, that is the vnion of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage doth continue, ſo long muſt loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection remaine.<note place="margin">Math. 5.44.</note> God commandeth vs, to loue our neighbours as our ſelues, becauſe they be of our fleſh. Albeit therefore, that he contemne, hate, offend, or wrong vs: albeit he be our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and in reſpect of himſelfe, deſerueth not that wee ſhould loue him, yet becauſe hee is of our fleſh, the foundation of loue remaineth, we muſt loue him. How much rather ought they to put this in practiſe, who by the bond of marriage, are made one fleſh? The rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vnion betweene man and wife, is without compariſon more ſtraight, &amp; bindeth them each to loue other, much more then the coniunction, wehreby man is vnited vnto his neighbour,</p>
               <p>But this is the miſchiefe, that in many, their loue is not grounded vpon the vnion of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage but vpon beautie, riches, and other car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and worldly conſiderations, ſubiect to change, alterarion and loſſe.</p>
               <p>This corruption that reſpecteth beautie, is olde, and noted to bee among the cauſes of the flood.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſonnes of God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daughters of men were faire, lusted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, and tooke them in marriage.</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8506:96"/> it is mony that maketh loue, and riches ingender affection, witneſſe the experience of our daies. Yet ſuch loue, reſembleth onely a fire of ſtraw, which is but a blaze, and is ſoone out, vnleſſe it be continued with great wood, or other like ſubſtance. Loue growing of beautie, riches, luſt, or any other like ſlight, vncertaine, and fraile groundes, is ſoone loſt and vaniſhed, vnleſſe it be maintayned with the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this vnion, of two in one fleſh, and the vertues thereto adioyned: and therefore muſt euery man thinke vpon this vnion in marriage, that he may enioy, nouriſh, and continue the loue, that thereof proceedeth, the rather, becauſe ſuch loue is the nurſe of concord, that maketh marriage happy. As contrariwiſe, the want of this loue, is the fountaine of ſtrife, quarrelling, debate, and other like afflictions, that conuert the paradice of marriage into a hell. For diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene man and wife, is the trouble and ouerthrow of the houſehold.</p>
               <p>They that will auoide ſuch ſtrife, muſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loue each other: and eſpecially, they muſt haue care hereof, when they are firſt married: For a veſſell made of two peeces, and glewed togither, may at the firſt bee eaſilie broken, but in time, groweth ſtrong: ſo is it alſo with two perſons, that are glewed or ioyned togither, by the bond of marriage.</p>
               <p>This loue, the mother of peace, will ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8506:97"/> a care and dutie, each to ſupport other, and ſo to practiſe the ſame, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in all beleeuers: that is, <hi>To be gentle one to another, frendly, &amp; each to forgiue other, euen as God hath forgiuen vs through Chriſt,</hi> Let the husband thinke, that he hath married a daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> with all her infirmities: and likewiſe let the woman thinke, that ſhe hath not maried an Angell, but a childe of <hi>Adam,</hi> with his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And ſo let them both reſolue to beare that, that cannot be ſoone amended. Let not the body complaine of the head, albeit it haue but one eye: neither the head of the body, albeit it be crooked or miſhapen. Such defaults, do neuer breake vnion and loue between the head and the body: neither muſt the infirmities of the husband or the wife, infringe the loue that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of the vnion and coniunction of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. If the husband bee giuen to brawling, or the wife to chiding, let them both beware of giuing any occaſion.</p>
               <p>The bell hath a loude ſound, and therfore he that will not heare it, muſt beware how he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the rope and ſhake it: ſo if the one will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to chide without a cauſe, let the other be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deafe and ſo not heare it, or dumbe, and ſo make no anſwere. So that where the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is deafe, and the wife blinde, marriage is quiet and free from diſſention. Whereby is meant, that the wife muſt winke at many
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8506:97"/> infirmities of her husband, as if ſhe ſaw them not, and the husband put vp many ſhrewde ſpeeches of his wife, as if he heard them not. Neither can it be any reproch to the husband and wife, ſo ſtedfaſtly vnited, to practiſe this dutie, conſidering that <hi>Dauid</hi> proteſteth, that he vſed the like patience and diſcretion among his enemies: <hi>They that ſeeke after my life, lay ſnares, and they that goe about to doe me euill,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.12.</note> 
                  <hi>talke wicked things, and imagine deceit conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually: But I as a deafe man, heard not, and am as a dumbe man, which openeth not his mouth. Thus I am as a man that heareth not, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This vnion betweene man and wife, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo engender that dutie which the holy Ghoſt noteth, ſaying:<note place="margin">Matth. 19.5. Epheſ. 5.31.</note> 
                  <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue his father and mother; and cleaue to his wife.</hi> As alſo the wife in the like reſpect, is bound to the like dutie toward her husband. Not that marriage exempteth any from their due honour and obedience to parentes, but to declare that the vnion betweene man and wife, is greater, then betweene the children and the parentes. And indeede, the true loue of the husband to the wife, and of the wife to the husband, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all loue of children to their parents.</p>
               <p>The husband and the wife, haue their ſecret counſels and communication of matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their profit and commoditie. The wife
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8506:98"/> is more obedient to her husband, and the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band more deſirous to pleaſe his wife, then their parents: yea, and at length it falleth out, that they depart from their parentes, to keepe houſe by themſelues. And this plainely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Lea</hi> and <hi>Rachell</hi> being ſiſters,<note place="margin">Gen. 26.</note> and the wiues of <hi>Iacob.</hi> For <hi>Iacob</hi> grieued at the wrong offered him by their father <hi>Laban,</hi> boldly made his moane to them.</p>
               <p>Whereupon they alſo complaining of their father, agreed with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and conſented to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, to leaue their father, and to follow their husband <hi>Iacob.</hi> Herein likewiſe conſiſteth an other dutie of the husband to the wife, and of the wife to the husband: namely, that they ſhew no greater ſecrecie or communication, of their houſehold affaires to their parents, then mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally each to other: and this rule is eſpecially to be put in practiſe, when there groweth any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content betweene themſelues. For if the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhal complaine to his parents of his wife: or the wife of her husband, ſuch dealing might breed a moſt dangerous iealouſie, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently perhaps irreconciliable diſſention and ſtrife. But if it ſhould grow to any complaint, it were requiſite, ſo diſcreetly to proſecute the matter, as that the wife ſhould come to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands parents, &amp; the husband to the wifes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. So ſhould all cauſe of iealouſie ceaſe, and the complaint procure moſt aſſured remedie.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:8506:98"/>
               <p>This loue and agreement in marriage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth yet another dutie, common both to the husband and the wife. And that is, that they neuer ſeeke, neyther once thinke of diuorce. And to that ende, let them remember what is written:<note place="margin">Mat. 19.6.</note> 
                  <hi>That which God hath ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let no man put aſunder.</hi> Likewiſe, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Adulterie, may ſeparate thoſe that are vnited by marriage.</p>
               <p>All other agreements and contracts, made by mutuall conſent, may be broken and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by the like conſent of both parties: but in the contract of marriage, Almightie God commeth in as a witneſſe: yea, he receiueth the promiſe of both parties, as ioyning them in that eſtate.</p>
               <p>And this doth <hi>Salomon</hi> note,<note place="margin">Pro. 2.17.</note> where hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth to the Harlot, that ſhee hath forgotten the couenant or alliance of her God. But <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie</hi> ſpeaketh more plainly, and giueth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why God puniſhed ſuch husbands, as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their lawfull wiues, tooke others:<note place="margin">Mala. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Lord hath beene witneſſe betweene thee and the wife of thy youth, againſt whom thou haſt tranſgreſſed, yet is ſhe thy companion, and the wife of thy couenant.</hi> The promiſe therefore to God cannot be broken, but onely by his authoritie.</p>
               <p>In the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> husbands were eaſily and ſoone intreated, to forſake their wiues,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:8506:99"/> by giuing them a Bill of diuorce: yet ſo far was this courſe from being lawfull, that contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;<note place="margin">Mat. 19.8.</note> Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: that it was tolerated onely in reſpect of the hardneſſe of husbands hearts, who otherwiſe would haue vexed their wiues, and intreated them cruelly.</p>
               <p>And this libell containing the cauſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce, and putting away of the woman, did iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie her, and condemne the man.

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19.8.</note> 
                  <hi>except it bee for whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and marrieth another, committeth adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: and whoſoeuer marrieth her, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced, doth commit adulterie with her.</hi> So ſtraight is the bond of marriage.</p>
               <p>Hereof it followeth, that notwithſtanding, whatſoeuer difficulties that may ariſe between the husband and the wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it be long, tedious, and incurable ſickneſſe of either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: whether naturall and contrary humours, that breede debate, wrangling, or ſtrife, about houſehold affaires: whether it bee any vice, as

Yet ſtill the bond of marriage remaineth ſtedfaſt; and not to be diſſolued. Neither may they bee ſeparated, euen by their owne mutual conſent.

And therefore are thoſe women, which vpon the hard dealing, or troubleſome diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their husbands, do forſake them, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reproued, as thereby giuing occaſion of great miſchiefe and trouble: as alſo are thoſe husbands, who vpon like occaſion, doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their wiues.

                  </label> The anſwere is, that ſuch infirmities muſt not diſſolue, or breake the bond of marriage, and their duties to liue togither: but let them thinke that God hath called them to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of patience, which vpon heartie prayer be graunted to them.</p>
               <p>Let them labour, each to beare with other, that they may liue in peace, and continually pray to GOD, to giue them grace ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>Let them remember, that the diuell transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himſelfe into an Angell of light, when by propounding a dutie to liue in quiet, and conſequently a meane to pray vnto God, for the compaſſing thereof, hee induceth them to gaine-ſay Gods prohibition, and alſo
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8506:101"/> to ſeperate that, which God hath ioyned togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as the coniunction commeth of God, ſo the ſeparation and diuorce proceedeth from the diuell.</p>
               <p>If they reply, that by liuing aſunder; ſo that they marrie not againe, they breake not the bond of marriage: let them remember, that marriage being ordained for a remedie againſt fornication, for the generation ad bringing vp of children, and alſo for a helpe each to other, in mutuall ſocietie, and inſeparable conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life: yet doth there appeare no token or effect of marriage, in thoſe that liue aſunder, albeit they marrie not againe. So that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of marriage, conſiſteth not only in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of children, but alſo in the natural ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the two diuers ſexes. Otherwiſe it could not be ſaid, that there were any marriage betweene two old folkes.</p>
               <p>This vnion of marriage, yet teacheth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother duetie, common both to the man and to the wife. Which is, that their goods bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon betweene them. That a common wealth may in ſome ſort bee ſaid to bee happie, where they haue no vſe of theſe words: <hi>Mine, and thine.</hi> But in marriage eſpecially, they ought not to be heard. If the wife haue brought moſt goods in marriage the marriage once conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and made, her part is gone, and they are gone, and they are made common: as alſo are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8506:101"/> the debts, whether hers, or her husbands. And therefore can neither of them ſay: This is mine, but this is ours. When a woman hath brought great goods, yet may ſhee not ſay: I will doe with mine owne what I liſt: for ſhe her ſelfe, is not her owne, but her husbandes.</p>
               <p>The husband, as the head and chiefe guide of the familie, muſt haue the cuſtodie &amp; chiefe gouernement of the goods in the houſe: yet may he diſcharge himſelfe of the whole, or of part, as himſelfe ſhall thinke meet and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: yet let him remember, that hee intreat her not as a ſeruant, by giuing her money, as it were in miſtruſt, or with condition to returne him a particular account. For the husbandes miſtruſt, doth many times prouoke the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and the wiues vaine expence, breedeth miſtruſt in the husband: but the faithfull and diſcreet employment, and good vſage of the wife, and her husbands confidence in her, will procure, that as the goods be common to both, ſo each alike ſhall vndertake the cuſtodie and employment of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Hereunto, for a concluſion of this point, we will yet adde two dueties, common both to the husband and the wife. The firſt, that they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray to God to giue them grace, to liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in peace and loue, and that each may be a helpe to others ſaluation. Let all ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to enioy ſuch a felicitie, vnderſtand, that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8506:102"/> they muſt dayly pray to God for the obtaining thereof. And let thoſe that liue in ſtrife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, examine themſelues, whether they haue no cauſe to impute their miſerable eſtate, to their neglect of this dutie. The ſecond, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the practiſe of the ſame: which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, ſaying: <hi>Let thoſe that be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.29.</note> 
                  <hi>be as if they were not married.</hi> But how? By ſo enioying the commoditie, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of marriage, that the benefite of their coniunction, breed no diuorce betweene God and them: likewiſe, that thereby they bee not hindered, or made ſlacke in any dutie toward God and their neighbours: as alſo that no affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction depending or proceeding of marriage, withdraw them, or force them to reſolue of any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the vnion of marriage, &amp; their chriſtian profeſſion, that they bee the children of God.</p>
               <p>The particular dueties of the husband to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the wife, are: firſt to protect her, to haue regard and care ouer her, &amp;c. Ruth 3.9. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that hee vnfainedly loue her, out of which fountaine, ſpringeth this dutie, that hee muſt beare with her infirmities, and not by and by, to enter into bitterneſſe and wrath: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.7.</note> 3.16. To the ſame end S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorting husbands to behaue themſelues diſcreetly, and with knowledge and wiſedome toward their wiues, her requireth of them 2 things: Firſt, that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8506:102"/> they neuer ſay nor do any thing, that may iuſtly offend their wiues: as ſome there be, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prodigall, great ſpenders, or idle and ſlacke in their buſineſſe, do cauſe their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to languiſh in pouertie.</p>
               <p>Others, who haunting Tauernes, Alehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Gaming, doe conſume and waſte that, which ſhould maintaine their familie.</p>
               <p>Others, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming home drunke, doe beat and vexe their wiues, and as it were, driue them into diſpaire: Others, who by vile &amp; bitter ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by threatnings, &amp; other vnchriſtian acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnworthy a husband, doe prouoke their wiues, and ſo ſtirre vp ſuch ſtrife and debate, as do conuert the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of marriage into an hell.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore, that the husband is head, he ought in ſuch wiſedome, reaſon, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to beare himſelfe, that he giue his wife no iuſt occaſion of offence or prouocation: yea, he muſt remember, that if the head be drunke, the whole body is in danger of weake gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen of lying in the myre.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that albeit the wife ſhould mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter iuſt cauſe of griefe and diſpleaſure, yet that the husband ſhould not thereof take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt his wifes infirmities, or enter into bitterneſſe, tauntes, or diſquietneſſe: but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, and patiently beare with her, that ſo they might quietly and louingly liue togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:8506:103"/>
               <p>The hurt or weakneſſe of any one member of the bodie, prouoketh not the head to wrath or bitterneſſe: but rather to compaſſion, and an inclination to helpe it. And indeed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God hauing created woman the weaker veſſell, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> noteth, did ſo ioyne her to man, it was not to the end, that hee ſtriuing with ſo fraile a veſſel, ſhould bruiſe and breake it: but that by gentle and diſcreet intreating, he ſhould quietly enioy the helpe, that God hath giuen him.</p>
               <p>Let him therefore, after the counſell of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.7. Gen 3.18.</note> ſo reſpect her, as one, who albeit ſhe be weake, is neuertheleſſe a profitable veſſell for him. Moreouer, let him loue and honour her as one, whom notwithſtanding the frailtie of her ſexe, God hath ſo honoured, and Jeſus Chriſt ſo loued, that being togither with man, redeemed with his blood, ſhee is togither with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, coheite of life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>A chriſtall Glaſſe, is a precious and profitable veſſell, yet brittle: ſo is the married woman. For albeit ſhe be brittle, yet is ſhe profitable to her husband, and precious in the ſight of God, as a child of God, and member of Chriſt. As therefore a man doth more carefully take heed of breaking ſuch a glaſſe, then ſome earthen or tinne veſſell, the one being more baſe, and the other more ſtrong: ſo likewiſe ſhould the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band haue ſuch regard of the frailetie of his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:8506:103"/> wife, that hee may beare with her, and intreate her with gentleneſſe and diſcretion: that hee may vſe her, as a precious and profitable veſſel, to his comfort &amp; ioy. And in as much, as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is an excellent ſeruice, that God requireth of vs, and the ready meanes to purchaſe his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, let the husband diſcreetly beare with his wife, leaſt otherwiſe through their ſtrife and contention, their prayers (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) might be letted and interrupted. 1. Pet. 3.7.</p>
               <p>Yet muſt we not ſay, but the husband, both may, and ought to tell his wife of her infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that ſhe may amend. But here we are to enter into conſideration of ſundrie points. Firſt hee is eſpecially to reproue her offences againſt God: As when <hi>Rachell</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Iacob:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 30.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue me children or elſe I die.</hi> Hee reproued her of importunitie, ſaying: <hi>Am I in Gods ſtead, who hath withholden from thee, the fruite of thy wombe?</hi> Alſo when <hi>Iobs</hi> wife ſaide to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: <hi>Doeſt thou abide in thy integritie?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſe God and die.</hi> He wiſely reproued ſuch a wicked ſpeech ſaying: <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt as an vnwiſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. What? ſhall we receiue good at the hand of God, and not receiue euill?</hi> Secondly, that it be with gentleneſſe and teſtimony of good will: as <hi>Helcana</hi> dealt with his wife <hi>Hanna,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1, Sam. 1.</note> when ſhe mourned becauſe ſhe had no children. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it is meet, that the husband ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his wife louingly, rather by perſwaſion,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8506:104"/> then by force. For as in a great ſtormie winde, a man lappeth his cloake about him, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it faſt for feare of looſing, but when the wind is downe, and the weather calme, he let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it hang eaſily: ſo, when husbands will (as it were) perforce, wreſt away their wiues infirmities, many of them will obſtinatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, yet contrariwiſe, by ſweet words, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing exhortations, they might bee wonne, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to forſake them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the husband muſt ſeeke diligently to remoue the occaſion and ſtone, whereat his wife ſtumbleth, and taketh occaſion of griefe. So when <hi>Sarah</hi> was moued againſt <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 16.</note> becauſe of <hi>Agar,</hi> and obiected vnto him, albeit wrongfully, that hee was the cauſe, that ſhee contemned her: bearing with his wife, hee remoued the cauſe of the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſuffering her to turne <hi>Agar</hi> out of doores.</p>
               <p>He muſt alſo take heed, that he himſelfe bee not tainted with the ſame vice, which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth in his wife, leaſt ſhee ſtop his mouth, with the reproach of the ſame fault: but rather by giuing her example by the contrary vertue: let her be induced and led to follow him. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the wife, the husband muſt alwayes vſe ſuch diſcretion, that ſhee be not brought into contempt: and therefore it ſhould neuer bee done in the preſence of moe then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For as it is meere folly for a husband to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8506:104"/> praiſe and commend his wife in company: ſo is it as dangerous, to checke and reproue her before witneſſe. For indeed thereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that women, not being able to beare that diſgrace, will replie, and ſo prouoke ſtrife, and diſſention in open preſence, which wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to great reproch &amp; offence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the husband muſt not flatter his wife, ſo hee muſt not reproue her before ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>A wiſe husband, and one that ſeeketh to liue in quiet with his wife, muſt obſerue theſe three rules. Often to admoniſh: Seldome to reproue: And neuer to ſmite her.</p>
               <p>Let the husband alſo remember, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of his wife, muſt bee eyther taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or borne withall. So that he, that can take them quite away, maketh his wife farre more commodious and fit for his purpoſe: and hee that can beare with them, maketh himſelfe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more vertuous.</p>
               <p>The husband is alſo to vnderſtand, that as God created the woman, not of the head, and ſo equall in authoritie with her husband: ſo alſo he created her not of <hi>Adams</hi> foote, that ſhee ſhould be troden downe and deſpiſed, but hee tooke her out of the rib, that ſhe might walke ioyntly with him, vnder the conduct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of her head.</p>
               <p>And in that reſpect, the husband is not to commaund his wife, in manner, as the Maſter
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8506:105"/> his ſeruant, but as the ſoule doth the bodie, as being conioyned in like affection &amp; good will. For as the ſoule in gouerning the bodie, tendeth to the benefite and commoditie of the ſame: ſo ought the dominion and commandement of the husband ouer his wife, to tende to reioyce and content her.</p>
               <p>To conclude: As God hath teſtified his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular goodneſſe vnto man, in creating him an helper to aſſiſt him: ſo let him conſider, in how many ſorts ſhe is to him a helper, to paſſe ouer this life in bleſſedneſſe. And let this dayly ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſuch a benefite receiued at the hands of God, induce and ſtirre him vp to render thanks, and to diſpoſe himſelfe to vſe it well, to his owne comfort and ſaluation: and not to abuſe it, to the deſtruction both of himſelfe and his wife. But if he chaunceth (as many doe) vpon troubles, and afflictions in marriage, let him remember, that the ſame doe proceede, not properly from marriage, but from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the parties married: and for his parte, let him ſtudie to amende his infirmities and faults, by amendment of life: and withall, pray to God to graunt the like grace vnto his wife, to the ende, that the more they recouer the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, the more feeling they may haue of the felicitie of Marriage: which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> had enioyed, had they continued, as they were created, in the Image of God.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8506:105"/> And the particular duties of the wife to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, are principally theſe: firſt, that ſhe bee a helper vnto him, &amp;c. Secondly, that ſhe bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto him, &amp;c. Theſe foure ſpeciall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are partly touched before, and partly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>As loue matrimoniall is greatly allowed of God, and much commended of all good men, as an ordinate, holie, and godly loue: ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, hatred, diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſtrife, debate, vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and frowardnes in mariage, highly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, and much grieueth al good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. And therefore the deuill, the enemie of all vnitie, concord and agreement, laboureth by all meanes he can, (eſpecially at the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the maried folkes to dwell together) to ſow diſſention, diſcord, and to cauſe them not to agree, but to diſlike one of the other; againſt whom they muſt diligently watch, by feruent and earneſt prayer to God, that the diuell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile not againſt them, by ſuch too early diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement. For as two boords at the firſt, if they be not well coupled and ioyned together, they neuer are faſtned right afterward: but if the firſt coupling and ioyning together bee good, then can there afterward no violence driue the boords aſunder: yea, the whole boord doth ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner breake, then the glewing of them together: euen ſo the husband and wife muſt bee verie carefull and diligent, that their firſt cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8506:106"/> &amp; dwelling togither,<note place="margin">The beſt pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is to begin well.</note> belouing, delectable, and friendly; and not ſeparated through anie ſpightfull contention or diſcord: ſo ſhall the whole eſtate of their mariage be more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and proſper the better as long as they ſhal liue. And though there happen to ariſe any ſparke of diſcorde betwixt them, yet let them beware, that at the leaſt there bee not too much diſpleaſure, diſdaine, and inconuenience kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereby. For if at their firſt dwelling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there ſhall fall out ſuch vntowardneſſe, and vncomely diſcorde, then will it now and then bee breaking out: euen as it fareth with great wounds, and broken legges or armes, which ſeldome are ſo throughly healed, but ſometimes they haue paine at the change of the weather. So likewiſe, if married folkes behaue themſelues thus vntowardly and vnhoneſtlie the one towards the other at the firſt, and if iars and diſcord be once begun betweene them, the old canker of hatred will breed againe, though it bee ſcaled afterward. Let the one therefore learne betime to be acquainted with the nature and conditions of the other, and to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues according to the ſame, in as much as they muſt needes dwell together, one to enioy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the one to liue and dye with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo ſtedfaſtly and vnfainedly to loue one the other, that neither of them haue anie thing ſo deare, which they cannot bee content
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8506:106"/> to giue and beſtow one vpon the other: yea, euen their owne life, if need require. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore husbands and wiues muſt euen at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their marriage giue their diligence, that all iniuries and offences may be auoyded: for tender and ſoft loue is ſoone diſſolued and broken. So that this new loue and coniunction of the minde, muſt be nouriſhed with benigne, ſweet, &amp; gentle conuerſation, vntill it be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed &amp; faſtned, that no great ſtorme be able to diſſolue or breake it. And all ſuſpition muſt be at all times, but ſpecially at the beginning of matrimonie, eſchued and ſhunned, leaſt they ſhould firſt begin to hate, or euer they begin to loue: yea, and they muſt beware they doe not faine any ſuſpition, nor conceiue it of any light occaſions and coniectures: for vnto ſuch they in no wiſe muſt giue eare, although there were ſome ſhew and great apparance of likelihood. And this will bee a good meanes to effect and worke this: namely, if they accuſtome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſpeake kindly, louingly, and cheerfullie one to the other. For as the ancient Counſellors of king <hi>Salomon</hi> gaue wiſe aduiſe and counſell vnto <hi>Rehoboam</hi> king of Iſrael,<note place="margin">1. King. 12.7, 8. &amp;c.</note> to the end that hee might win the loue and good liking of the people: <hi>Speake kindly vnto them</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>and they will ſerue thee for euer after:</hi> which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell not being followed, great inconuenience and miſchiefe after befell vnto him, &amp;c. Euen
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8506:107"/> ſo likewiſe, if the husband bee deſirous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the loue of his wife, and to winne her to God: or if the wife be deſirous, and would alſo procure the loue of her husband, and win him to God; then they muſt draw on one another with ſweet and gentle words of loue, ſpeaking kindly one to another:<note place="margin">Iudg. 19.3. Prou. 15.1.</note> becauſe <hi>gentle words do pacifie anger,</hi> as water quencheth fire. But if they ſhall vſe taunts, or words of reproach and deſpight one againſt another,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.9.</note> much hurt then may enſue thereof: <hi>for a little leauen ſowreth the whole lumpe.</hi> And therefore let them vſe to giue one to the other their dutifull names and titles, and to eſchue and ſhun the contrarie. For example, like as the ſpightfull Iewes, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lord Ieſus, would not vouchſafe to giue him his name, when they talked of him, or with him, but to ſhew their vtter diſlike of him they vſed to ſay:<note place="margin">Iohn. 7.11.15.35.</note> 
                  <hi>Is this he?</hi> or, <hi>art thou he that wilt doe ſuch a thing? Js not this he? &amp;c.</hi> Againe, <hi>Whither will he goe that we ſhall not finde him?</hi> They would not ſay, Is not this Ieſus Chriſt? or the Sonne of God? This is a moſt deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kinde of ſpeaking, and doth bewray abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of malice that was hidden in their harts: euen ſo it ſometimes falleth out betwixt the husband and the wife, betwixt the father and the ſonne, betwixt the maſter and the ſeruant, &amp;c. that they could ſpeake dutifully one to an other: but contempt and diſdaine, anger and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8506:107"/> malice, will not ſuffer the one to affoord vnto the other their due names and titles, leaſt they ſhould bee put in minde of thoſe duties, which theſe names require: whereout Sathan ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ſmall aduantage: whereas many times the very name of husband, or wife, father or ſonne, maſter or ſeruant, &amp;c. doth greatly helpe to perſwade the minde, and to winne the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: yea, the very mentioning of theſe names doe oftentimes leaue a print of dutie behinde in the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Husbands muſt not forget this point, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is not ſufficient for them to declare, and outwardly make a ſhew of a good life, in words and precepts onely, but alſo in life and deede: ſo that two things are very neceſſarie for him to rule withall: to wit, wiſedome, and example, and that he himſelfe fulfill the thing that he commandeth to bee done. The life and outward conuerſation of a man, whether it bee good or euill, doth not onely perſwade, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conſtraine and inforce. We doe ſee how mightie and auailable this or the like exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Captaine is in the time of warre and battell: Oh my ſouldiers, doe that ye ſhall ſee me doe: the which contempt of death in the Captaine, doth ſo creepe through the whole hoſt, that there is not one, be he neuer ſo feeble and weake hearted, that doth eſteeme his life, for the which hee perceiueth that his Captaine
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8506:108"/> careth ſo little for. Thus did Chriſt with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Martyrs, draw the world vnto the Chriſtian faith: Leuit. 11.44. &amp; 19.2. &amp; 20.7. and 21.8. Iohn 13.15. Phil. 3.17. 1. Tim. 1.16. 2. Theſſ. 3.9. For as they liued, ſo they ſpake, and as they ſpake, ſo they liued. Therfore if the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would haue his wife to bee temperate, quiet, chaſt, painful in her calling, religious, &amp;c. then he muſt be carefull that he be not diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, vnquiet, no whoremonger, not careleſſe in his calling, nor irreligious &amp;c. So that if hee commaund any thing to be done, he muſt firſt looke that hee denie not to doe the ſame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſo ſhall his wife and familie obey the ſame, and to be the more readier and willinger to doe it, being both honeſt and lawfull to bee done.</p>
               <p>The very name of a wife, is like the Angell which ſtaied <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 22.11.</note> when the ſtroke was comming. If <hi>Dauid</hi> becauſe hee could not expreſſe the commoditie and comfort of vnitie, and brotherly loue, was faine to ſay: <hi>Oh how good and ioyfull a thing it is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 133.1.</note> 
                  <hi>for brethren to dwell together in vnitie?</hi> Then let husbands weigh and conſider, how harſh and bitter a thing it is for them and their wiues to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in enmitie and ſtrife. For the firſt yeare after marriage,<note place="margin">Deut. 24.5.</note> God would not haue the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band goe to warre with his enemies, to the end that he and his wife might learne to know one
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8506:108"/> anothers conditions and qualities, and ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards liue in godly peace, and not to warre one with another, and therefore God gaue and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, that the new married husband that yeare is to ſtay at home and ſettle his loue, that he might not warre and iarre after: for the God of peace dwelleth not in the houſe of warre. As a kingdome cannot ſtand, if it be diuided:<note place="margin">Matth. 12.25.</note> ſo a houſe cannot ſtand, if it be diuided: for ſtrife is like fire, which leaues nothing but duſt, ſmoke and aſhes behinde it. We reade in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of maſters that ſtrooke their ſeruants, but neuer of any that ſtrooke his wife, but rebuked her.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 19.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Lot</hi> was drunk whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he lay with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in ſtead of a wife: and ſo is he which ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his wife in ſtead of his ſeruants. The law ſheweth how a bondman ſhould be corrected: but the wife is like a iudge, which is ioyned in commiſſion with her husband to correct other. Wilt thou ſtrike one in his owne houſe? no more ſhouldſt thou ſtrike thy wife in her houſe. She is come to thee as to a Sanctuary, to defend her from hurt: and canſt thou hurt thy ſelfe? Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſ. 13.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Are wee not brethren?</hi> that is, may brethren iarre? but they may ſay, are wee not one? can one chide with another? can one fight with another? Hee is a bad Oſte that welcomes his gueſt with ſtripes. Doth a King trample on his Crowne? <hi>Salomon</hi> calleth the wife,<note place="margin">Prou. 12.4.</note> 
                  <hi>The crowne of her huſbands</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:8506:109"/> therefore hee which woundeth her, woundeth his owne honour. She is a free Citizen in thine houſe, and hath taken the peace of thee the firſt day of her mariage,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 2.23. Epheſ. 5.19.</note> to holde thy hands till ſhee releaſe thee againe. <hi>Adam</hi> ſaith of his ſpouſe, <hi>This is fleſh of my fleſh: But no man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) euer hated his owne fleſh.</hi> So then, if a man aske whether he may ſtrike his wife? God ſaith nay: thou maiſt not hate thy wife: for no man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his owne fleſh: ſhewing, that he ſhould not come neere blowes, but thinke his wrath too much.</p>
               <p>Some husbands are wont to ſay, that they will rule their wiues, whatſoeuer they bee, or howſoeuer they came by them, and that it is in the hand and power of the husband, what, and of what qualities and conditions ſhe ſhall bee. True it is, that a great part of this doth reſt and lie in the husband, ſo that he vnderſtand as hee ought to doe, that mariage is the ſupreme and moſt excellent part of all amitie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and that it farre differeth from tyrannie, the which doth compell men to obey. Truly it may force the bodie, but not the will, in the which all loue and amitie doth conſiſt and ſtand: the which if it bee drawne and forced, doth reſiſt, and bow like a palme tree to the contrary part. And the husband may aſſure himſelfe that there cannot bee any quiet mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age or vnitie, where hee and his wife doth not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:8506:109"/> agree in will and minde: the which two, are the beginning and ſeate of al amitie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And ſuch husbands as do brag, and think themſelues able to rule, and ouer-rule their wiues: by that time they haue proceeded and gone a little further, they ſhall well feele and perceiue themſelues to bee beguiled, and finde that thing to bee moſt hard and intricate, the which to bee done, they eſteemed moſt light and eaſie.</p>
               <p>Some husbands there be, that through euill and rough handling, and in threatning of their wiues, haue and vſe them not as wiues, but as their ſeruants. And yet ſurely they are but very fooles, that iudge and thinke matrimonie to be a dominion. For ſuch as would be feared, doe afterwards pitiouſlie lament and complaine, that they can finde no loue in their wiues, whoſe loue and amitie, through their own cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and hard dealing, they haue turned into hatred. And whereas at the beginning, they glorying and cracking thus cruelly to bee their wiues maſters, they haue now purchaſed vnto themſelues a moſt miſerable and lamentable life in time to come: ſeeing now that all loue and pleaſure is caſt aſide, and compaſſed with feare and ſuſpition, hatred and ſorrow. Surely, if a husband (as nature, reaſon, and the holie Scripture doe witneſſe) bee the head ouer his wife, and God their father: there ought to bee
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:8506:110"/> betweene them ſuch ſocietie and fellowſhip: yea, and greater then is betweene the father and his ſonne, and not ſuch as is betweene the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and the ſeruant. And amongſt many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that may bee vſed to perſwade the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife to liue together louingly, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and chriſtianly, this is not the leaſt: namely, that for as much as neither of them is certaine how long they ſhall liue together, and then the partie that ouerliueth purpoſing to marrie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and hauing been churliſh, froward, &amp;c. with his former wife: or ſhe with her firſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, which their ſo hard dealing one with the other before being knowne, will (no doubt) be an occaſion that they ſhall not ſpeed &amp; match ſo well, as otherwiſe they might, if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued themſelues peaceably, and dutifully in their firſt mariage.</p>

And laſtly, that ſhe doo not weare gorgeous apparell, beyond her degree and place, but her attire muſt bee comely and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8506:110"/> ſober, according to her calling. The firſt point is prooued by the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule:</hi>

               <p>Now for ſo much as the Apoſtle would haue Chriſtian wiues, that are matched with vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly husbands, and ſuch as are not yet good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to reuerence and obey them: much more they ſhould ſhew themſelues thankful to God, and willingly and dutifully performe this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſubiection, when they are coupled in mariage with godlie, wiſe, diſcreete, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, gentle, louing, quiet, patient, honeſt, and thriftie husbands.<note place="margin">Wiues muſt be ſeruiceable and obedient vnto their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, &amp; ſtand in a reuerend awe of them.

                  <note place="margin">Prou. 16.1. and 18.22. and 19.14. and 31. all.</note> &amp; others. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>A wiſe woman buildeth vp the houſe: and bleſſed is the man that hath a diſcreet wife.</hi> Yet ſtill a great part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ſuch women, ſhall reſt in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their husbands to bee their heads, and ſo vſing the graces that they haue receiued of the Lord, that their husbands may be honored, not contemned, neither of them nor of others: which falleth out contrarie, when the wife will ſeeme wiſer then her husband. So that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie and gouernment ought to bee in a wife: namely, that ſhe ſhould not ſpeake but to her husband, or by her husband. And as the voyce of him that ſoundeth a trumpet, is not ſo lowd, as the ſound that it yeeldeth: ſo is the wiſedome and word of a woman, of greater vertue and efficacie, when all that ſhe knoweth, and can
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8506:114"/> doe, is as if it were ſaid and done by her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. The obedience that the wife oweth to her husband, dependeth vpon this ſubiection of her will and wiſedome vnto him. As 1. Pet. 3.6. Epheſ. 5.33. Eſter 1.1, 2. &amp;c. 12. So that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not prouoke their husbands by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in matters that may bee performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to God: neither to preſume ouer him, either in kindred or wealth, or obſtinately to refuſe in a matter that may trouble houſehold peace and quiet. For diſobedience begetteth contempt of the husband, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt wrath, and is many times the cauſe of troubles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the man and the wife. If the obedience importeth any difficultie, ſhe may for her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe gently propound the ſame: yet vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to obey, in caſe the husband ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in his intent, ſo long as the diſcommoditie importeth no wickedneſſe. For it is better to continue peace by obedience, then to breake it by reſiſtance. And indeede it is naturall in the members, to obey the conduct and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the head. Yet muſt not this obedience ſo far extend, as that the husband ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing contrary to her honour, credit and ſaluation, but as it is comely in the Lord: Col. 3.18. Epheſ. 5.22. Therfore, as it were a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous matter, and the means to ouerthrow the perſon, that the body ſhould, in refuſing all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection &amp; obedience to the head, take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8506:115"/> guide it ſelfe, and to commaund the head: ſo were it for the wife to rebell againſt the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Let her then beware of diſordering and peruerting the courſe, which God in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath eſtabliſhed: and with all let her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that going about it, ſhe riſeth not ſo much againſt her husband, as againſt GOD: and that it is her good, and honor, to obey God in her ſubiection &amp; obedience to her husband. If in the practiſe of this dutie, ſhe finde any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie or trouble, through the inconſiderate courſe of her husband, or otherwiſe; let her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the ſame proceedeth not of the order eſtabliſhed by the Lorde, but through ſome ſin afterward crept in, which hath mixed gall among the honie of the ſubiection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haue enioyed in that eſtate, wherein together with <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhe was created after the image of God. And ſo let her humble her ſelfe in the ſight of God, and be well aſſured that her ſubiection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is acceptable vnto him. Likewiſe, that the more that the image of God is reſtored in her, and her husband, through the regeneration of the holie Ghoſt, the leſſe difficultie ſhall ſhe finde in that ſubiection and obedience: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their mariage haue in deede tried, to their great contentment and conſolation.</p>
               <p>Further, there is a certaine diſcretion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire required of women to pleaſe the nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8506:115"/> &amp; maners of their husbands, ſo long as the ſame imports no wickedneſſe. For as the looking-glaſſe, howſoeuer faire and beautiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adorned, is nothing woorth, if it ſhew that countenance ſad, which is pleaſant: or the ſame pleaſant, that is ſad: ſo the woman deſerueth no commendation, that (as it were) contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her husband, when he is merie, ſheweth her ſelfe ſad; or in his ſadneſſe vttereth her mirth: for as men ſhould obey the lawes of their cities, ſo women the maners of their husbands. To ſome women, a becke of her husband is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to declare that there is ſomewhat amiſſe that diſpleaſeth him, and ſpecially if ſhe beare her husband any reuerence. For an honeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron hath no neede of any greater ſtaffe, but of one word, or one ſowre countenance. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, a modeſt and chaſte woman that loueth her husband, muſt alſo loue her houſe, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that the husband that loueth his wife, cannot ſo well like of the ſight of any ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtrie, as to ſee his wife in his houſe. For the woman that gaddeth from houſe to houſe to prate, confoundeth her ſelfe, her husband, and familie: Titus 2.5. But there are foure reaſons why the woman is to goe abroad. Firſt, to come to holie meetings, according to the dutie of godlineſſe. The ſecond, to viſit ſuch as ſtand in neede, as the dutie of loue and charitie doe require. The third, for employment and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:8506:116"/> in houſehold affaires committed to her charge. And laſtly, with her husband when hee ſhall require her.<note place="margin">The wife muſt keepe a good tongue.</note> Gen. 20.1. &amp;c. The euill and vnquiet life that ſome women haue, and paſſe with their husbands, is not ſo much for that they commit with, and in their perſons, as it is for that they ſpeake with their tongues.<note place="margin">When the wife doth holde her peace, ſhe kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the peace. The cauſe of domeſticall combats.</note> If the wife would keep ſilence when her husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to chide, he ſhould not haue ſo vnquiet dinners, neither ſhe the woorſe ſupper: which surely is not ſo: for at the ſame time that the husband beginneth to vtter his griefe, the wife then beginneth to ſcold and chafe; wherof doth follow, that now &amp; then moſt vnnaturally they come to handy gripes, more beaſtlike the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianlike: which their ſo doing is both a great ſhame,<note place="margin">Silence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a woman.</note> and a foule diſcredit to them both. The beſt meanes therefore that a wife can vſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and maintaine the loue and good liking of her husband, is to bee ſilent, obedient, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, patient, ſtudious to appeaſe his choler, if he bee angrie, painfull and diligent in looking to her buſineſſe,<note place="margin">Lacke of knowledge of Gods word, is the principall cauſe why wiues doe not their dutie to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note> to be ſolitarie and honeſt. The chiefe and ſpeciall cauſe why moſt women do faile in not performing this dutie to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, is, becauſe they be ignorant of the word of God, which teacheth the ſame and all other duties: and therefore their ſoules and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences not being brought into ſubiection to God and his word, they can neuer vntill then,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8506:116"/> yeeld and performe true ſubiection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their husbands, and behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo euery way, as chriſtian wiues are in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bound to doe. But if wiues bee not ſo duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, ſeruiceable, and ſubiect to their husbands, as in conſcience they ought; the onely cauſe thereof, for the moſt part, is through the want and neglect of the wiſe, diſcreet, and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment that ſhould be in the husbands: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the want of good example that they ſhuld giue vnto their wiues both in word and deede.<note place="margin">One heart and one will.</note> For as the common ſaying is: Such a husband, ſuch a wife: a good Iacke maketh a good Gill. For ſo much as mariage maketh of two perſons one,<note place="margin">How the loue, faithfulneſſe, and dutie of maried folkes may be kept and increaſed.</note> therefore the loue of the husband and wife may the better bee kept and increaſed, and ſo continued, if they remember the duties laſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, as alſo not forget theſe three points fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They muſt be of one heart, will and mind, and neither to vpbraide, or caſt the other in the teeth with their wants and imperfections any waies, or to pride themſelues in their gifts: but rather the one to endeuour to ſupplie the others wants, that ſo they both helping &amp; doing their beſt together, may be one perfect bodie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It doth greatly increaſe loue, when the one faithfully ſerueth the other, when in things concerning mariage the one hideth no ſecrets nor priuities from the other, and the one doth
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:8506:117"/> not vtter or publiſh the frailties or infirmities of the other: and when of all that euer they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or get, they haue but one common purſe together, the one locking vp nothing from the other: and alſo when the one is faithfull to the other, in eating, drinking, and ſo in all their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and affaires. Likewiſe, when the one harkneth to the other, and when the one think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſcorne of the other, and when in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the gouernment of the houſe, the one will be counſelled and aduiſed by the other: and alwaies the one to bee louing, kind, curteous, plaine, and gentle in words, maners and deedes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the one learne euer to be obſequious, diligent, and ſeruiceable to the other in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. And this will the ſooner come to paſſe, if the one obſerue and marke what thing the other can away withall, or cannot away withall: and what pleaſeth or diſpleaſeth them. And ſo from thence-forth to do the one, and to leaue the other vndone.<note place="margin">They muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly keepe no euill will in their mindes, but tell their griefe.</note> And if one of them bee angrie and offended with the other, then let the partie grieued, open and make knowne to the other their griefe in due time, and with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for the longer a diſpleaſure or euill will rageth in ſecret, the worſe will be the diſcord. And this muſt bee obſerued, that it bee done in a fit &amp; conuenient time: becauſe there is ſome ſeaſon, in the which if griefes were ſhewed, it
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8506:117"/> ſhould make greater debate. As if the wife ſhould goe about to tell or admoniſh her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band when he is out of patience, or moued with anger, it ſhould then bee no fit time to talke with him.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.36, 37.</note> Therefore <hi>Abigail</hi> perceiuing <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> her husband to bee drunke, would not ſpeake to him vntill the morning. Both the husband and wife muſt remember, that the one be not ſo offended and diſpleaſed with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the other,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Matth. 19.6. Matth. 19.9. &amp; 5.33. Luke. 16.18.</note> that they ſhould thereupon forſake the companie one of the other: for that were like to one that being ſtung with the Bees, would therefore forſake the honie. And therefore no man may put away his wife for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſe, except for whoredome, which muſt be duly proued before a lawfull Iudge. But all godly and faithfull married folkes are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their ſtate &amp; mariage to God, by humble and feruent prayer, that he for his beloued ſons ſake, would ſo bleſſe them and their mariage, that they may ſo chriſtianly and dutifully agree betweene themſelues, that they may haue no cauſe of any ſeparation or diuorcement. For like as all maner of medicines (and ſpeciallie as they that goe nigheſt death, as to cut off whole members, &amp;c.) are very lothſome and terrible: euen ſo is diuorcement indeed a medicine, but a perilous and terrible medicine. Therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good Chriſtian husband and wife, ought with all care and heedfulneſſe, ſo to liue in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8506:118"/> that they haue no need of ſuch medicine. As the holie Scripture maketh mention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiues and women that were wicked and vngodly, as partly may be ſeene by theſe quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, 1. King. 11.1, 2. Prou. 21.9.22.14. and 25.24. and 27.15. Eccleſ. 7.28.30: So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, the ſame ſacred Scripture alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vnto vs many women that haue been deuout, religious and vertuous: as partly is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by that which hath already been ſaid: and alſo by theſe places of Scripture, Ruth. 3.11. 1.

                  <note place="margin">The wife ought to obey her husband in all things, that be honeſt and agreeable to Gods word.</note>Now, if a wife be deſirous to know how farre ſhe is bound to obey her husband, the Apoſtle reſolueth this doubt, where he ſaith, Eph. 5.22. ſaying, <hi>Wiues, ſubmit your ſelues vnto your huſbands, as to the Lord.</hi> As if hee had ſaid: Wiues cannot bee diſobedient to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, but they muſt reſiſt God alſo, who is the

The firſt ſubiection of the woman began at ſinne: for when God curſed her for ſeducing her husband, when the Serpent had deceiued her, he ſaid: <hi>He ſhall haue authoritie ouer thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſ. 3.16.</note> And therefore as the man named all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in ſigne that they ſhould bee ſubiect to him, as a ſeruant which commeth when his maſter calleth him by his name: ſo he did name the woman alſo,<note place="margin">Heſt. 1.20.22. Numb. 30.7, 8, 9. 1. Pet. 3.6. Iudg. 19.26.</note> in token that ſhe ſhould bee ſubiect to him likewiſe. And therefore <hi>Aſsue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> made a law, that euery man ſhould beare rule in his owne houſe, and not the woman.

               <p>Amongſt the particular duties that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wife ought to performe in her familie,<note place="margin">It is a ſpeciall dutie of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to giue her children ſucke her ſelfe.</note> this is one: namely, that it belongeth to her to nurſe her owne children, which to omit, and to put them forth to nurſing, is both againſt the law of nature, and alſo againſt the will of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is hurtfull both for the childes bodie,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8506:119"/> and alſo for his wit: and laſtly, it is hurtfull to the mother her ſelfe, and it is an occaſion that ſhe falleth into much ſickneſſe thereby.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Nature giueth milke to the woman for none other end, but that ſhe ſhould beſtow it vpon her childe. We ſee by experience, that euery beaſt, and euery fowle, is nouriſhed and bred of the ſame that did beare it: onely ſome women loue to be mothers, but not nurſes. And as euery tree doth cheriſh and nouriſh that which it bringeth forth: euen ſo alſo it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth natural mothers to nouriſh their children with their owne milke.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.10.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the example of the Scriptures are many that proue this. As <hi>Sarah,</hi> who nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iſaack,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſ. 22.7.</note> though ſhee were a Princeſſe, and therefore able enough to haue had others to haue taken y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paines: as alſo hauing bin a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull woman, euen in olde age being of great yeares, yet ſhe her ſelfe nurſeth and giueth ſuck to her ſonne.<note place="margin">1.

Iudg. 13.24. Cant. 8.1. Pſalm. 22.9. Matth. 2.14. Luke. 2.7.12.</note> as though God would haue none to nurſe him but his mother. Likewiſe, after when the Sonne of God was borne, his father thought none fit to be his nurſe, but the virgin his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a commendation of a good woman,

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as refuſe thus to doe, may well and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called nice and vnnaturall mothers: yea, in ſo doing they make themſelues but halfe-mothers, and ſo breake the holy bond of nature, in locking vp her breaſt from her child, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering it forth like the Cuckoo, to bee hatched in the Sparrowes neſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, the childrens bodies be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo affected, as the milk is which they receiue. Now, if the Nurſe bee of an euill complexion, and as ſhe is affected in her bodie, or in her minde, or haue ſome hidden diſeaſe, the childe ſucking of her breaſt, muſt needs take part with her. And if that bee true which the learned doe ſay, that the temperature of the minde followes the conſtitution of the bodie, needes muſt it be, that if the nurſe be of a naughty nature, the child muſt take thereafter. Yet if it bee that the nurſe bee of a good complexion, of an honeſt beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: (whereas contrariwiſe, Maidens that haue made a ſcape, are commonly called to be Nurſes) yet can it not bee, but that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers milke ſhould bee much more naturall for the childe, then the milke of a ſtranger. As by experience, let a man bee long accuſtomed to one kinde of drinke, if the ſame man chaunge his ayre, and his drinke, he is like to miſlike it.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8506:120"/> As the egges of a Henne are altered vnder a Hawke: neuertheleſſe, ſuch women, as be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with infirmities, diſeaſes, want of milke, or other iuſt and lawfull cauſes, are to be diſpenſed withall, but, whoſe breaſts haue this perpetuall drought? Forſooth, it is like the gowte, no beggers may haue it, but Citizens or Gentlewomen. In the 9. of Hoſea, verſe 14. drie breaſts are named for a curſe. What a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable hap haue Gentlewomen, to light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this curſe, more then other? ſure, if their breaſts be drie, (as they ſay) they ſhould faſt and pray togither, that this curſe might bee remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, that it is hurtfull to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers themſelues, both Phiſitions can tell, and ſome women full oft haue felt, how they haue beene troubled with ſore breaſts, beſides other diſeaſes, that happen to them, through plentie of milke.</p>
               <p>The wife is further to remember, that God hath giuen her two breaſts, not that ſhe ſhould employ and vſe them for a ſhew, or of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but in the ſeruice of God, and to bee a helpe to her husband, in ſuckling the child co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them both. Experience teacheth, that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerteth her blood into the milke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the child is nurſed in the mothers wombe. He bringeth it into the breaſts, furniſhed with nipples, conuenient to miniſter the warme
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:8506:120"/> milke vnto the childe, whom he indueth with induſtrie, to drawe out the milke for his owne ſuſtenance. The woman therefore, that can ſuckle her child, and doth it not, but refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this office and dutie of a mother, declareth her ſelfe to be very vnthankefull to God, and (as it were) forſaketh and contemneth the fruit of her wombe. And therefore the bruit beaſts ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the ground, &amp; granting not one nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or two, but ſixe or ſeuen to their yong ones, ſhall riſe in iudgement againſt theſe daintie halfe-mothers, who for feare of wrinckling of their faces, or to auoid ſome ſmall labour, doe refuſe this ſo neceſſary a dutie of a mother due to her children. The properties due to a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wife, are, that ſhee haue grauitie when ſhee walketh abroad: wiſedome, to gouerne her houſe: patience, to ſuffer her husband: loue, to breed and bring vp her children: courteous to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her neighbours: diligence, to lay vp, and to ſaue ſuch goods as are within her charge: a friend of honeſt company, and a greater ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of wanton and light toyes. 1. So then, the principall dutie of the wife, is, firſt to bee ſubiect to her husband, Epheſ. 5.22. Col. 3.18. 1. Pet. 3.1. 2. To be chaſte and ſhamefaſt, modeſt and ſilent, godly and diſcreet. 3.

For the courſe &amp; condition of the world is ſuch, that husbands and wiues doe account and recouer things paſt, better then things that be preſent. And the reaſon is, becauſe no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie or felicitie is ſo great, but it hath ſome griefe and diſpleaſure, and alſo ſome bitterneſſe mingled with it: which ſo long as it is preſent grieueth vs ſore, but when it is one gone, it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no great feeling of it ſelfe behinde it: and for that cauſe wee ſeeme to bee leſſe troubled with ſorrowes and diſcommodities paſt, then with thoſe that are preſent. Alſo age ſtealeth and commeth on apace, which cauſeth both men and women to be the leſſe able to ſuſtaine and indure troubles and griefes now, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Therefore ſuch men and women as bee twiſe married, and be wiſe and religious, ought not to eſteeme their wife, or husband which is dead, better then her or him which they enioy now aliue: remembring the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, That we muſt liue by the quick, and not

Therfore to the end that both their loues may be ſetled towards the children of the one and the other, they muſt remember that they are ſtead-father and ſtead-mother: that is, in ſtead of their owne father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore they ought to loue them, to tender them, and to cheriſh them, as their owne father or mother did. They muſt not look vpon them like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who told his people,<note place="margin">1.

For that man and that woman that are led with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, reaſon, and conſideration, will reckon
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:8506:122"/> himſelfe and his wife all one: and likewiſe, ſhe will account herſelfe and her husband as one. And therefore they ought to account both the children of the one, and of the other, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them both: for if friendſhip make all things common among friends, inſomuch, that many haue loued &amp; fauoured their friends children, as their owne; how much more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and perfectly ought mariage to cauſe the ſame, which is the higheſt degree, not only of friendſhips, but alſo of al blood and kindred. But Step-mothers doe more often offend, and faile in this dutie, then men, by reaſon that their affections bee ſtronger then mens, and many times ouer rule them: and therefore they are earneſtly to bee admoniſhed and warned, that they ſhew themſelues to thoſe motherles chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, no ſtep-mothers friendſhip, but a right motherly kindnes. Let the ſtep-mother adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly conſider, that God hath ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed her (in ſtead of their owne mother) to bee to them a right true mother, and not onely to regard them as children, but as orphane chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and requireth her to loue them, and to do them good, as to her owne. What a griefe would it be to her hart, if ſhe ſhould know now that her owne children whom ſhe hath borne in her owne bodie, ſhould (after her death) haue a ſtepmother that would be rigorous, churliſh, and vnkinde vnto them? doubtles thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens

                  <hi>ſo it ſhall be meaſured to you againe:</hi> That is, as the ſtep-mother doth intreate the children of her predeceſſor, ſo another wife may come after her, and intreate her children: for he that tooke away the firſt mother, and ſent her, can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſecond mother, and ſend a third, which will not bee like a ſtead-mother to hers, vnleſſe ſhe bee like a ſtead-mother to theſe. Verely, a good woman will bee vnto her husbands chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that which ſhe may heare them call her ſo often: that is, Mother. For what chriſtian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is ſo farre from all humanitie and naturall affection, that will not be moued and mittiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this word Mother, of whom ſoeuer it be ſpoken? And chiefly of children which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flatter, but ſpeake euen ſo from their heart, like as they would to their owne mother, of whom they were borne.

                  <note place="margin">The firſt point</note>1. Touching the firſt point, Parents are to be admoniſhed, that they beare in minde, that the cauſe why the Lord hath bleſſed them with children, is: firſt, that they ſhould be carefull to ſee that their children be ſo vertuouſly brought vp, that they may become citizens of the church of God: ſo that whenſoeuer they themſelues ſhall dye in the Lord, they may leaue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren true worſhippers of God in their place:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:8506:124"/> but alas, there bee few that haue any great care of this dutie.</p>
               <p>It is to bee remembred,<note place="margin">The children of Chriſtians ought not to be called by any popiſh name.

Let vs here conſider, that ſo often as in the race of our life wee doe heare or doe ſpeake of our name, it doth put vs in remembrance: firſt, of Gods mercie ſhewed vnto vs in our baptiſme: ſecondly, of our promiſe to God againe. And as in times amongſt our anceſtors,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.59. and 2.21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Proper names are alſo giuen vnto vs, for this vſe and end, that is, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man.</note> Infants had their names giuen them when they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, as appeareth in <hi>Luke</hi> no doubt to this end that the circumciſed ſhould be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the calling by their names, at what time and place they had their names giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſhould thinke that they are written in the number of the children of God, and ioyned in league with him, and made partakers of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant: ſo likewiſe after the ſame maner, muſt we that haue had our names giuen vs in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,

               <p n="2">2. Secondly, they muſt aſſure themſelues, that all their labour is loſt which they beſtow vpon their children, vnleſſe they bring them vp in the feare of God, and oftentimes call vpon Gods helpe by earneſt prayer, that he in mercie would vouchſafe to preſerue them from the manifold ſnares, ſubtilties, and temptations of Sathan, which their tender age is ſubiect vnto. We may heare many parents complaine of the diſobedience of their children: but they do not marke &amp; conſider that they are iuſtly puniſhed by God, for that they thinke by their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie and wit, to make them good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, without Gods bleſſing, which they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer call for in good earneſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, let them conſider how noble a thing a child is, whom God himſelfe hath ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and formed in his mothers wombe, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, brought foorth into the light, and indued with bodie and ſoule, to the end he ſhould (as it were in a table) repreſent God his firſt paterne.<note place="margin">Inſtructing, correcting, and praying, make good children, and happie Parents.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, let them know that theſe things are to be dealt withall in order. Vnto the bodie, nouriſhment, bringing vp, apparell, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time correction, that they may keepe their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:8506:126"/> children in awe.<note place="margin">1. King. 2.2, 3. Geneſ. 34.30. Iohn 1.5.</note> Vnto the ſoule they owe cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing, inſtruction and doctrine: and that of two ſorts, namely, of godlineſſe, and of ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. By the one, they ſhall keepe a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before God. By the other, they ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a good report among men. For theſe are the two principall points which parents ought to bee moſt carefull to plant in this life in their children: both which the Apoſtle comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in one verſe, where he ſaith, Epheſ. 6.1. <hi>Ye, fathers prouoke not your children to wrath, but bring them vp in instruction, and information of the Lord.</hi> And therefore all parents are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to inſtruct and teach their children the firſt principles of Chriſt his religion, ſo ſoone as by age they are able to perceiue and vnderſtand the ſame, that they may (as it were) ſuck in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe together with their mothers milke, and ſtraight waies after their cradle, may bee nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the tender foode of vertue towards that bleſſed life. To haue godly children (no doubt) is the greateſt treaſure that may be. For in the children doe the parents liue (in a maner) euen after death. And if they be wel inſtructed, catechiſed, and vertuouſly brought vp, God is honoured by them, the common wealth is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced: yea, their parents, and all other fare the better for them. They are their parents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, next vnto God, their ioy, ſtaffe, and vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their age: and therefore parents ought
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8506:126"/> to begin betimes to plant vertue in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens breaſts: for late ſowing bringeth a late or neuer an apt Harueſt. Young branches will bow as a man will haue them, but olde trees will ſooner breake then bow. And therefore as arrowes are an excellent weapon of defence, to a ſtrong and a mightie man that can ſhoote them with courage: euen ſo children godly brought vp, are a ſpeciall protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to their parents. And as the ſtrong mans quiuer, the better it is furniſhed with choſen ſhafts, the better defence he hath: ſo likewiſe the more godly children that parents haue, the greater is their ioy and happineſſe. Yea and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as arrowes are at the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of the owner to be vſed: euen ſo children wel taught, are at the commandement of godly parents.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, let parents remember how many ſinnes they commit and heape one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which doe not their dutie in bringing vp their children, as they ought to doe. Firſt, they tranſgreſſe the law of nature, which telleth all men, that their dutie is to bring vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren godlily and honeſtly. Secondly,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.7, 8. &amp; 4.9. &amp; 11.19. Pſalm. 71.5, 6, 7, 8. Ioſu. 4.6.</note> they ſinne againſt God: for they deſpiſe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authoritie of God: for hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that children ſhould bee brought vp reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly and honeſtly: but hee is a deſpiſer of God that refuſeth to doe as he is commaunded. Thirdly, he offendeth againſt his own credit &amp;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:8506:127"/> eſtimation.<note place="margin">Exod. 12.26.27. Luke 11 12.</note> For Gods wil is, that parents ſhould (after a ſort) be in his ſtead, ſo farre forth as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to outward diſcipline. But ſuch make ſmall account of this dignity, who neglect their dutie in this behalfe. Parents are further to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it is their dutie to haue diligent care to ſee their children taught to pray to God, and to rehearſe the Apoſtles Creed, and the ten commandements. For as by this exerciſe their hearts and mindes ſhall the rather bee inclined to godlineſſe and reuerence toward God; ſo as they increaſe in age, they ſhall euery day bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then other comprehend that which they learne, to their owne comfort, and inſtruction to ſaluation. Alſo, as the tongue is called the glorie of man, becauſe that beſides al other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by his ſpeech hee is diſcerned from the brute beaſts: ſo it is meete, that ſo ſoone as the childe can begin to ſpeake, his tongue ſhould bee employed to glorifie God, by calling vpon him, and by learning ſome ſhort Catechiſme, containing the principles and grounds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion: as alſo in repeating the will of God in ſuch ſort, as he wil that we ſhould ſerue and honour him.</p>
               <p>If parents doe note or perceiue any vice in their little ones, as ſwearing, lying, choller, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie filching, couetouſneſſe, contempt of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, readineſſe to ſtrife, and other like corruptions: it is their duty, diligently and in time to reproue
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8506:127"/> and correct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as men vſe to pluck vp weedes while they bee yet young, leaſt growing vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the good ſeedes, they ſhould hinder their growth, and choke them vp. By experience we can ſee, that mothers in ſwadling their little ones, doe lay their limmes right, each in his place: likewiſe, if a childe bee giuen to bee left handed, they chide him: yea, ſometimes they binde it vp, or otherwiſe reſtraine the vſe of it, that hee may bee accuſtomed to vſe his right hand. Alſo, if the childe haue ſome ſtring vnder his tongue, they cut it, leaſt it ſhould hinder his ſpeech: much more then ought they to beware, that through their negligence the vices of the ſoules doe not increaſe: for it is the dutie of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, euen in the infancie, to begin to ſhape and frame the ſoule vnto vertue.</p>
               <p>It is alſo the dutie of parents to prouide that their children may learne, at the leaſt to write and reade: for it may bee vnto them a great helpe in the courſe of this life, and a treaſure of much greater account then money. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the negligence of many is ſharply to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. Beſides that, the performance of the duties herein, doth greatly binde their children vnto them. Neuertheleſſe, the principall ende thereof ſhould not haue reſpect to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, as the children may reape thereby to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the vſe of this preſent life: but rather that they may reade the word of God to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:8506:128"/> and inſtruction to ſaluation. As alſo it were their parts to vſe them daily to reade ſome chapters of the holie Scriptures, thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and winne their affections to the word of God, to inure and acquaint them in the phraſe of the holie Ghoſt, by little and little to learne the heauenly doctrine, to note the examples of Gods vengeance powred vpon the wicked and diſobedient: and of his bleſſings vnto thoſe that walke in his feare. Therefore if parents do look that their children ſhould obey them, then let them ioyne &amp; accuſtome them to Gods word, which will redownd much to their parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. If they cauſe their children to heare &amp; reade the holie Scriptures, therein they may learne, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother:</hi> But if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents doe otherwiſe, then they traine them vp in the ſcriptures of diuels, whereout their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will learne moſt wicked things: but it is not ſo when they are inſtructed in the holie Scriptures. Parents therefore are diligently to apply themſelues to this which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and ſo often and earneſtly commendeth vnto them: namely, to inſtruct their children in the knowledge and feare of GOD, and in the faith of Ieſus Chriſt: Deut. 6.6.7. and 32.46. Epheſ. 6.4. So alſo to teach them thoſe things which they are to vſe in their age. It is then great follie to linger children in the learning of vaine, trifling, and vnprofitable things, which
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8506:128"/> as they grow in yeares, they will contemne and forget. Parents can be carefull enough to bring vp their children in ſome courſe, trade, or other eſtate, wherein to get their liuings when they come to be men: and verely ſuch fathers as do neglect that, are vnworthie to haue children. But as the ſoule is more precious then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; ſo is it the dutie of pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, in youth to traine vp their children in the practiſe of thoſe things, wherewith in age, euen in this life, they may glorifie God, and be heires of the Lord. If pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents want knowledge, or bee vnwilling to take leiſure to teach them; yet let them doe as much for their childrens ſoules, and the life to come, as for their bodies, and this preſent life. Parents that either cannot write and reade, or will not, or haue not time to teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will yet ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſchoole: and ſuch as would haue them learne ſome Art or Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or traffique, if themſelues profeſſe not the ſame, wherein they like to employ their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they will yet put them to dwell with thoſe that doe profeſſe the ſame, to the ende they may learne. How therefore can parents excuſe themſelues, when their children remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught in thoſe things that concerne the glorie of GOD, and life euerlaſting? But howſoeuer it bee, if they be neither able of themſelues, nor doe prouide to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taught by others, they ſhall bee inexcuſable in the ſight of God: and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8506:129"/> the ignorance of the children, ingendring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, loue of the world, and neglect of heauenly felicitie, will crie out for euerlaſting vengeance againſt their parents: ſo that if they account not their children as beaſts without ſoule, or if they loue them with the due loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to parents let them declare their loue eſpecially to the ſoule: the chriſtian inſtruction whereof ſurmounteth all worldly treaſure.</p>
               <p>Some ſay, it would bee a great comfort for them in heauen to know their neere kindred, and conſequently their children: and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of naturall affection. But might it not bee a greater diſcomfort for them, euen in their life time to ſee them goe to hell for want of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Some charge their children to be dull witted, and hard to be bowed, or brought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodneſſe or vertue. Albeit naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee a great helpe or profiting, yet exerciſe and cuſtome to do well, is a mightie meanes to bend and ſhape them that way: yea, euen ſuch that by experience we finde this olde prouerbe true: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe ouer commeth nature.</hi> As the wheele-wright doth by ſtrength bow his timber, &amp; let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it lie long in that bent, it abideth crooked. Barren ground well tilled, ſoyled and ſowen with good feed, groweth fruitfull, and yeeldeth good increaſe. Iron weareth with handling: The water by continuall dropping weareth the ſtone: Wilde beaſts may be tamed: and wilde
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8506:129"/> colts by cuſtome be brought to the ſaddle, and are content to be led by the bridle euen ſo the dulleſt capacities may by inſtruction and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome be faſhioned to vertue. As contrariwiſe, the wit moſt inclined by nature to vertue, may by bad inſtruction and the conuerſation of the wicked, be peruerted and grow vicious.</p>
               <p>Parents therefore are herein to reſpect two points: firſt, to begin to frame and bend their children in their tender youth to vertue, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that a ſeale entereth deepeſt into ſofteſt waxe. They muſt be carefull, that they do not ſpeake or tell any fooliſh tales, bawdie rimes, or vngodly ſpeeches before their children: leaſt they infect their tender wits with follie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment. Experience ſheweth, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will ſooner learne any language by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, then elder folks. Alſo, that the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the twig is, the ſooner it is bent or made ſtraight. Secondly, it is the parents dutie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine their children from haunting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſing, with ſuch as be vicious, peruerſe, and wicked. And vndoubtedly we ſee, that they do ſoone learne villanous &amp; vnſeemely ſpeeches, and malicious lewd actions, with their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as the old prouerbe ſaith: Halting with the lame, they ſhall learne to halt. A child that naturally ſpeaketh wel, by conuerſing with ſuch as corrupt their ſpeech, ſhall degenerate and ſpeake as badly. Tie a yong twig that is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8506:130"/> crooked, with a ſtraight one, that is ſtronger then it, and in growing it will become ſtraight, and ſo continue when it is vndone. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, a ſtraight one tyed to that which is crooked, and ſtronger then it ſelfe, will grow and continue crooked.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, parents when they meane to put forth their children to any trade or occupation, eyther to learning, they then ought carefully to ſee and enquire, whether ſuch as they thinke to place them withall, bee r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ligious and vertuous, and endued with the feare of God.</p>
               <p>Many men in the admittance of a ſeruant, the feare of ſome temporall, or carnall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, cauſeth them to enquire of his, or her trueth, honeſtie, or other qualities. Therefore, if parents ſhall commit their child to the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and inſtruction of a maſter, before they make inquirie of his honeſtie &amp; chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, they plainely ſhew, that they haue leſſe care of the corrupting or infecting of their child with vice, then of ſome ſmal incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience that might happen by an vnhoneſt, and vnthriftie ſeruant. When they buy an earthen pot, they ſound vpon it, to ſee whether it be broken, leaſt they ſhould be deceiued in a ſmall piece of money: yet doe they not ſound, whether the maſter, to whom they commit their child, bee vicious, or vertuous: albeit by putting and placing him with one that is vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8506:130"/> and irreligious, they put him in danger of loſſe, both of body and ſoule.</p>
               <p>Some doe reſpect their friendſhip with ſome maſters, rather then their vertue, and ſo doe commit to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their children, leaſt they ſhould be angrie for putting them to another.</p>
               <p>Theſe men doe reſemble and bee like him, who being dangerouſly ſicke, vſeth the aduiſe of an ignorant Phyſition: that is, his kinſman or familiar friend, for feare he ſhould take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if he ſhould call another, albeit without compariſon, more learned and skilfull.</p>
               <p>If thou ſhouldeſt haue any waightie matter in law, wouldeſt thou rather commit thy cauſe to an ignorant &amp; negligent atturney, becauſe he is thy friend, then to him that were both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and learned? Making a Voyage through ſome dangerous Sea, wouldeſt thou in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, commit thy Ship to a young Pilot, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull, or drunke, becauſe hee is thy Friend? What a foole art thou, that wilt not take the like care of the profite, honour, ſafetie, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thy child?</p>
               <p>Others commit their children, either to him, that is beſt cheape, or by whom they may grow into greateſt aduauncement in the world, but neuer reſpect the hazard of their child, ſo they may eyther ſpare, or get worldly goods.</p>
               <p>Let them alſo bee carefull to reſtraine their children from vice, and to inure &amp; accuſtome
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:8506:131"/> them to vertue. As indeed the fathers that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, or cauſe their children to be inſtructed, doe farre excell ſuch, as onely doe beget them: for of theſe they receiue life onely: of the other good and vertuous life. Yet parents ought not ſo much to relie and reſt vpon the diligence of their childrens maſters, as neuer to care to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how they profite and goe forward in learning and vertue: for the regard of ſuch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, would make the maſters more carefully to diſcharge their duties. And thereof came the Prouerbe: <hi>The masters eye fatteth the horſe:</hi> and this, <hi>The maſters eye is the fruitfulneſſe of the garden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon theſe ſinnes enſue many puniſhments, both ghoſtly and bodily, as well in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as in the children: yea, and in all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture giueth great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darion to ſundrie men &amp; women, for their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly education, and vertuous bringing vp of their children: as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he commanded his ſonnes and his houſehold, to keepe the way of the Lord. So <hi>Dauid</hi> counſelled his ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> to ſerue God,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19. 1. Chro. 28.9. Act. 10.2. 2. Tim. 1 5. Parents muſt performe their dutie to their children mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately with great grauitie and authority. Gen. 22.7.8. Pro. 4.3.4, 5, 6 Pro. 3.1.2. &amp;c. That is thought to be well done, which is done by example. 2. Sam. 13.28.29. Ezech. 16.44. Eſay. 24.2. Fruites are wont to take their ſhape and nature of the tree.</note> with a perfect heart, and a willing mind. It is ſaid alſo of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that he feared God, and all his houſehold. Likewiſe of <hi>Eunica</hi> the mother of <hi>Timothie,</hi> that ſhee nouriſhed vp her ſonne in the words of faith, and good doctrine. For where a vertuous and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:8506:131"/> godly childhood goeth before, there a godly and vertuous age followeth after. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when the parents are not carefull to teach their children to know God, &amp; to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: when they do not breed them vp in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor reproue them when they doe amiſſe, they then become corrupt in their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; abominable in their doings: ignorant, and voyd of all knowledge and grace, and of reuerence or feeling of nature.</p>
               <p>If Parents be deſirous to haue their children vertuous, and honeſt indeed (as in conſcience they ought) then they muſt bee diligent and carefull to practiſe godlineſſe &amp; honeſtie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For we ſee by experience, according to the common Prouerbe. <hi>As the old cocke cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, the young learneth: ſuch a father, ſuch a ſonne: and ſuch a mother, ſuch a daughter.</hi> For like as when the head is well and ſound, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſtomacke pure from hurtfull humours, the bodie is commonly well affected: euen ſo, where the head or chiefe of any familie or houſehold, is religious and ſound in the faith, and feareth God, it commonly goeth well with all the houſehold.</p>
               <p>What ſhall it auaile, for parents to teach their children honeſtie &amp; modeſtie, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their workes and behauiour, do inuite them to wantonneſſe, and lewdneſſe? Verball inſtruction, without example of good deeds,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:8506:132"/> is a dead doctrine: and contrariwiſe, good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are the life of inſtruction, to make it profitable and effectuall. If the example of parents be contrary to their inſtructions: If (we ſay) they teach their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſobrietie, modeſtie, and chaſtitie, &amp; yet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues will follow drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, foule &amp; laſciuious ſpeeches, geſtures, and actions: it is as if with their tongues they ſhould ſay: be vertuous, and by the hands leade them with them to all vice and corruption. So that wicked parents are wicked counſellers to their children. If we would take him to bee a Monſter in nature, and vnworthie to liue in a Common-wealth, that ſhould counſell his childe to drunkenneſſe and fornication: what ſhall wee thinke of thoſe, who committing ſuch iniquitie, do by their example much more mightily put forward their children to ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, then by word they are able? What account can thoſe parents giue vnto GOD, who by their euill example, haue drawne into Hell their children, whom he deliuered to their charge to be guided into heauen? Albeit ſuch parents pitie not themſelues, yet at laſt let them take pitie of their children, and not carrie them with them into euerlaſting deſtruction. Such parents then deſerue grieuouſly to be reproued, as ſhall vſe any lewd ſpeeches, or ſhameleſſe behauiour in briefe, any worldly or carnal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the preſence of their children, to whom
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:8506:132"/> their example may be as a diſpenſation, to giue themſelues to the like. As alſo, how can they forbid that in their children, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues do commit? How can they correct them for the faults, which they themſelues vſe? Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it children, in reſpect and reuerence to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, dare not reply and ſay, that themſelues doe theſe things, for the which they reproue them: yet will the neighbours or others, obiect it to their ſhame. Beſides, their authoritie ſhal be ſo much the leſſe, in that they declare in their works and actions, that they allow that which they forbid in words. If parents therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that their inſtruction may be effectuall, and yeeld fruit, let them declare the ſame in holy life &amp; vertuous conuerſation: let them ſo order and gouerne themſelues, that their children ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, as it were in a glaſſe, may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſhoneſt ſpeech &amp; wicked deeds.</p>
               <p>Let them do as guides, that ſhew the right way ouer foordes and riuers, by going before thoſe whom they leade: that their children fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſteps and examples of their parents, may conforme themſelues to their vertues, and ſo with them, and by them, be led to ſaluation, and life euerlaſting.</p>

               <p>They bee charged by the fift commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to feed, to nouriſh,<note place="margin">Eſay. 28.10. Deut. 6.20. Exod. 12 26. and 13.14.

               <p>For the fountaine of all vertue, and chiefe of all mans felicitie, is good inſtruction, and right bringing vp. And contrariwiſe, children euill brought vp, bring ſhame &amp; great heart breake to their parents. As old <hi>Elie</hi> was corrected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,

For the comfort hee had of his ſonnes, was this, the Arke (the witneſſe of the Lords preſence) was loſt: thirtie thouſand of the people ſlaine, his two ſonnes <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> killed: who when newes thereof came to him, for ſorrow fell backeward, and brake his necke: vpon this his daughter in law, fell in trauell, and in trauell died: the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his houſe was glad to craue &amp; beg for a ſmall peece of ſiluer, and a morſell of bread.</p>

               <p>Let them therfore alway remember this,<note place="margin">How children ſhould be brought vp.</note> that they prouide and beſtow diligent labour, that their children be forthwith inſtructed in vertue and godlineſſe,<note place="margin">Hold thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in awe, and they ſhall haue thee in reuerence.</note> whilſt their wits are yet voyd from cares &amp; vices: and whilſt their age is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and tractable, and their minds flexible, and readie to euery thing, who then will keepe

The Emmets, or Piſmires are not taught to gather into their holes or hillockes,<note place="margin">Pro. 30.25. &amp; 6.6.7, 8.</note> in ſummer, whereby they ſhould liue in winter. Bees learne not to make their cels, to gather iuyce, and to make honey: but all theſe things bee done by inſtruction of nature. So euery liuing thing, the leſſe meete it is to learning, ſo much the more it hath of natiue prudence. But man neither can eate, nor goe, nor ſpeake, except he bee taught. Then if fertile fields, for want of tillage waxe barren: if trees being neglected, either bring forth no fruite, or elſe the ſame vnſauourie, without dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or grafting and pruning: if dogs be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete to hunt, the horſe and oxen vnapt to the plough, except mans diligence be put thereto: how wilde then and vnprofitable creatures would children become, except diligently and in due time they ſhould be faſhioned by good bringing vp? What a ſhame is this for any man to take great care to haue his dog well taught,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:8506:135"/> his horſe well broken, his land well husbanded, his houſe goodly trimmed, &amp; richly furniſhed: and yet to haue his childe ſhamely rude in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and altogether voide of al garniſhing and inſtruction of vertue and godlineſſe? What a great follie and madneſſe is this, for a father to take great care and thought how to get money and poſſeſſions, and to haue no regarde of his childe for whom the ſame is gotten? Which is no leſſe ſhame to heare, then if a man taking thought for the ſhooe, would ſet nought by the foot: or with great care and ſtudie would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, that there ſhould be no fault in the childes garment, not regarding the health of his bodie. This is (as the common ſaying is) To be penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and pound-fooliſh: to ſaue a ſticke, and burne a houſe: to ſaue a ioynt, and loſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But oh vaine man, haſt thou more care and deſire to leaue thy ſonne a faire building, and full of lands, then for to inſtruct him in the way of godlineſſe, and ſo leaue him a vertuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? Haſt thou rather a deſire to hoord vp treaſure for him,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.19.</note> with ruſt and moth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, then for to teach him the knowledge of God, which will not canker, but laſt for aye? Moſt parents (a pitifull thing to remember) be louing to the bodies of their children, but their ſoules they care not for: they deſire their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare in this world, but they paſſe not what they ſhall ſuffer in the world to come. Yea, fathers
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:8506:136"/> prouide lands, rents, reuenues, great annuities, fees and offices, for their children here: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, few prouide or bee carefull to haue them brought vp in vertue, and the feare of God. For the loſſe of their liues and bodies, they will ſore bewayle and much lament: but the health and ſaluation of their ſoules, they make no reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of: if they ſee them poore and ſicke, they ſorrow and ſigh: but though they ſee them ſin, and greatly diſpleaſe God, they are nothing grieued. It behooueth, that parents doe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerue, vnto what vices their children are moſt inclined, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by good meanes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and draw them from the ſame. As pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents be carefull to prouide temporal things for their childrens bodies, which are tranſitorie: ſo much more carefull ought they to prouide ſpirituall things for their ſoules. And as they be diligent to keepe the bodies of their children from fire and water, when they be young: ſo much more they ought to take care, that their ſoules be not poyſoned with vices, and falſe and erronious doctrine, when they come to yeeres of diſcretion: and this is the moſt acceptableſt ſeruice that they can doe to God.<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.1. Mat. 12.33.</note> Children are called the fruit of their parents. Therefore, as a good tree is knowne by bringing forth good fruit: ſo parents ſhould ſhew their goodnes in the good education of their children, which are their fruit. For like as fruitfull fields for lacke of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8506:136"/> tillage, waxe barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or as trees, being neglected, eyther bring forth no fruit, or elſe the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauorie, without the diligence of grafting and pruning: or as dogs bee vnmeet to hunt: the horſe &amp; oxen vnapt to the plough, except mans diligence be put thereto: euen ſo, how ſauage and vnfruitfull creatures would children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, except diligently, and in due time, they ſhould be faſhioned, by good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bringing vp.</p>
               <p>To teach a child in the trade of his way, as <hi>Salomon</hi> commandeth, Pro. 22.6. which is, not onely to inſtruct him vnto godlineſſe, but alſo vnto all other humane duties: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>
                  </label> wherefore this dutie then belongeth vnto parents, and they are bound to doe it. For who ſhould teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the child, but they which haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and commanding of him? But it is well knowne, that parents onely haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and commanding of their children, or ſuch as they ſhall procure for their better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and therefore this charge and dutie lieth vpon them, &amp; they muſt looke vnto it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, this is apparant euen by the generall law of nature, which hath taught y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very bruit beaſts to bring vp their yong. And further, this dutie is yet enforced from the oportunitie of the thing commanded. For euen as a plant will ſooner take nouriſhment, and thriue better in the ſoyle where it firſt grewe or ſprung vp,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:8506:137"/> then in any other ground, becauſe it liketh his owne ſoile beſt: ſo children will ſooner take inſtruction and good nourture from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whom they beſt like, and from whom they had their firſt being, then from any other: and therefore you parents are in fault, if your children bee not well taught. For whatſoeuer good commeth from the parent to the child, is naturall and kindly, no otherwiſe then the warme milke from the mothers dugge: you ſhall ſooner be heard of your children, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſage counſell of the ancient, or the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and mouing ſpeech of the learned. Laſtly, the rule of iuſtice doth require, that euen as the firſt parent <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 5.3.</note> and ſo all other after him, haue beene a meane of falling to al their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in the begetting of children in their owne image, which according to the law of creation, ſhould haue beene borne Gods Image: ſo now in lieu of this, al parents ſhould lend their hands to lift them vp againe, &amp; neuer ceaſe, vntill they ſee in ſome meaſure, the beautie of the firſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, &amp; the vertue of the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> This is confirmed by many teſtimonies of Scripture, as amongſt other, theſe doe proue. Deut. 4.9. and 11.18.19. Epheſ. 6.4. Pſal. 78.5. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this dutie of parents, is many times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Schoolemaſters, to Maſters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, to Dames, to Patrones, and Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſuch like: they muſt therefore
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:8506:137"/> vnderſtand, whoſoeuer they be, that they are bound by the voyce of the almightie, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and to do the dutie of parents, to all ſuch as are committed to their charge, as if they were their owne children.</p>
               <p>Now, the vices which ſome parents commit, in not performing theſe duties before and after named, and ought of them to bee eſchued, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, the ignorance of the parents: as if they be ſo rude, that they bee not able to teach their children, then they greatly offend God in the breach of this ſo neceſſary a dutie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt indeuour to get ſo much nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and knowledge, as that they may be able to inſtruct others vnder them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond vice is, the prophaneneſſe of many parents, who, ſo they may prouide liueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and neceſſaries for their children, they care for no more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third vice is committed, of ſuch poore parents, which make no great choiſe with what Maiſters and Dames they place their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo they may haue meate &amp; drinke ynough, and wages thereto competent, and are neither back-beaten, nor belly beaten, as they ſay. Alas, ſuch poore children, while they ſerue for their bellies, they may looſe their ſoules, becauſe they want godly maiſters and dames, to giue them wholeſome inſtruction, to holde them in by

                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:8506:139"/> good example, and to gouerne them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the feare of the Lord. Wherefore here let all Parents learne, that it is their dutie to make choiſe of ſuch maiſters and dames for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as are godly and religious, wiſe hearted, ſuch as are both able and wel diſpoſed, to traine vppe youth in all good nourture, and Gods ſeruice: and not onely this (for the greateſt care of all lieth vpon the parents) but alſo they muſt ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as conueniently they may, repaire unto them, and ſee how they profit, and holde them vp by their good counſell, and be carefull to intreate thoſe which haue the gouernment of them, to bee good vnto them, in this chiefe poynt aboue the reſt. For (as <hi>Salomon ſaith:) Life and death is in the power of the tongue:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 18.21.</note> ſo wee may well ſay, life and death is in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our children. If they be well brought vp, it ſhall be life vnto them: but if it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they are trained vp to euerlaſting death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth vice is, the fault of many mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and dames, who make no further recken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſeruants, then they do of their brute beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſo long as their worke and buſineſſe be well done by them, they care for no more, and they will teach them no further, then may ſerue for their owne turne and benefit: that is, to be a profitable ſeruant vnto them. Such mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters make their ſeruants drudges to the world and the diuell: and the life of ſuch youth, dieth
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:8506:139"/> while it ſhooteth vp. All theſe ſin and treſpaſſe againſt the will and word of God, becauſe they are contrary to good nourture and godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Parents muſt bee very carefull, that their children may learn ſome occupation, or profeſſion of life: and this is either mechanical, which wee call handicraft: or liberall, which is the learning of ſchooles: and the end of this is, eyther to get their liuing honeſtly, and in Gods ordinance, or elſe if they want no maintenance, to apply their profeſſion and trade to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Common-wealth. No child of what birth and ſtocke ſo euer he bee, ought to want this inſtruction and bringing vp. If thou ſay, my childe hath no need of any trade: yet the Common wealth and Gods Church haue need of him, for no man is borne for himſelfe, but his friendes will require one part, his kindred ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his countrie the third. And if handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts like thee not, thou haſt the liberall Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which no man euer was yet aſhamed, but many haue made them their crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <hi>Saul</hi> was anoynted King, while he was ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his fathers Aſſes:<note place="margin">1.

And againe, wee reade that thoſe two famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Eliſha</hi> and <hi>Amos,</hi> the one was called from the plough, and the other from keeping of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:8506:140"/> beaſtes: which examples doe plainely teach vs, that the great and reuerent God deſpiſeth no honeſt trade of life, bee it neuer ſo meane, but crowneth it with his bleſſing, to drawe all good mindes to his holy ordinance. But now a daies, ſuch is the pride of our harts (a thing to bee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented through all our land) that many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens children may not be brought vp in any trade. Oh it is too baſe and beggerly for them: they muſt liue of their lands, they muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their gentrie: a ſmall learning will ſerue their turne: but in the meane while, this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God is neglected, what miſery from hence enſueth? Who are the waſters of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? Who are the robbers and rouers in the Common wealth? Who are the deflowrers of maidens? Who are the defilers of matrones? Who are the corrupters of youth? and to ſpeake in one word, who are the ſeedes-men of al miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe in our countrie, but theſe children of gentlemen, who haue not been taught &amp; train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp in learning, or ſome occupation, while they were young? For euen as a weed, if it grow in a rancke ſoyle, wil waxe out of meaſure noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: ſo theſe children comming of honorable and worſhipful parents, brought vp, in eaſe, and pampered with the delights of gentrie, they waxe immeaſurably vicious, and who may keepe them vnder? neyther lawes, nor Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, nor any other good meane.</p>

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in ſpeech</note> Parents muſt teach their children to vſe faire ſpeech, not onely towards themſelues, but alſo towards others, and to call their betters by a reuerent and an honourable name: 1. Sam. 25.24. Mar. 10.17. Pro. 16.24.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to ſpeake modeſtly and humbly of themſelues, and this poynt of good manners, they may learne of that wiſe matrone <hi>Abigail,</hi> in 1. Sam. 25.41. where we reade, that when ſhe was ſent for of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to bee his wife, ſhee firſt bowed her ſelfe to the ſeruants, and then made this lowly anſwere to him that brought the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: <hi>Beholde, let thine Handmaide be ſeruant to waſh the feete of the ſeruants of my Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to admoniſh them, louingly to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute their frends and acquaintance, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all others, whom they take to bee chriſtians and bretheren: which conſiſteth in praying wel to others, wiſhing health and proſperitie vnto them: Luke. 1.28, 40. 1. King. 1.27.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mind, to acknowledge a benefit, where they haue receiued it, with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thankes: Eccleſ. 29.16. Geneſ. 30.37.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, to teach them to confeſſe an offence where it is committed, with humble crauing of pardon. An example hereof, they may haue in that vertuous and faire ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matrone <hi>Abigail,</hi> as they may reade in 1. Sam. 25.23. &amp;c. Oh that men and children ſawe what great daungers they drawe vpon them by the neglect of this

               <p>Againe, Parents muſt teach their children good manners, and ciuill behauiour, to riſe vp to their betters, to vncouer the head? to make obeyſance, to bee curteous towardes their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, to bee gentle and lowlie to their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and louing and kinde to all: this is no leſſe needfull for youth, then their meate and their drinke.</p>
               <p>Alſo to admoniſh them, to giue their elders and betters leaue to ſpeake before them: Iob. 32.4.5. That they keepe ſilence while their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are in place, vntill they be ſpoken vnto: and then they muſt make anſwere in few words, without vnneceſſary circumſtances, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the matter. And they may not be loude, babling, or hotte in ſpeech, but colde and milde: Pro. 17.27. Warne them, that they do not interrupt or trouble others while they are in ſpeaking Pro. 29.20. Wherefore, if children wil keep the bounds of good maners, they muſt not be ſtreporous or troubleſome in talke, but they muſt obſerue and take their due time and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:8506:141"/> courſe, and if there bee any thing ſpoken, vnto which they would willingly make aunſwere, they muſt eyther courteouſly craue leaue of him that ſpeaketh, or elſe they muſt carrie it in remembrance, vntill their turne commeth to ſpeake, which is the better of the twaine. And further, they muſt giue an entercourſe of ſpeech vnto others: and ſo ſuffer others to ſpeake by them: for there is a time to keepe ſilence, and ſo to heare others ſpeaking, for hee that will haue all the talke, paſſeth the boundes of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Moreouer,<note place="margin">Good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in geſture</note> Parents ought to teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how to frame their geſture to a reuerent and dutifull behauiour towards others, which conſiſteth in theſe poynts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is to meete thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards them. And of this they haue an example in holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> Geneſ. 18.2. where it is ſaid: <hi>And hee lifted vp his eyes and looked, and loe, three men ſtood by him, and when hee ſawe them, hee ranne to meete them from the tent doore.</hi> Againe, another example they may haue in King <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſitting vppon his regall throne: 1 King. 2.19. <hi>Bathſheba therefore went to King</hi> Salomon, <hi>to ſpeake vnto him for</hi> Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niiah, <hi>and the King roſe, to meet her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, to riſe vp to elders and betters, when they paſſe by them. And this is taught <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.23. <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe vp before the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:8506:142"/> hoare head, and honour the perſon of the olde man, and dread thy God, I am the Lord.</hi> But heere wee muſt warne you of a great abuſe, which for the moſt part is committed in all Churches, and which tendeth to the high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God: which is this, that neyther you your ſelues, neyther your children, nor ſeruants, do knowe the time of your duties: but you will then riſe vp to men, when both you and they ſhould kneele downe to God: as if one that is more honorable among you, ſhall come into the church, while you are vpon your knees in prayer vnto God, preſently you ſtart vp, and leaue God to reuerence men. Is this religion? is this deuotion becomming Gods houſe? is not this all one, as if a man ſhould ſay, ſtay GOD, heere comes in my father, my maiſter, my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull neighbour, and my good friend, to whom I am much beholden, I muſt doe my dutie vnto him, I muſt riſe vp till hee bee paſt, and then I will come to thee againe? What is this but to preferre men before God? this doing plainely ſheweth, that ſuch are louers of men, more then God: and that ſuch as take this dutie and reuerence vpon them, are rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Gods honour, and they ſhall anſwere him for it. Is there no time to ſhewe our dutie towards men, but euen then, when wee are about Gods ſeruice? Why, know thou, when man ſtandeth before God, how honourable
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8506:142"/> ſo euer hee bee, hee is but dung and filth, and not to bee regarded: and let Parents learne this wiſedome, that while they are taught their duties towards men, it is not to robbe God of his worſhip: but there is an appoynted time to euery dutie and purpoſe: as <hi>Eccleſiastes</hi> in his third chapter well admoniſheth:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>To all things there is an appoynted time, and a time to euery purpoſe vnder the heauen.</hi> It is recorded of <hi>Leuie,</hi> to his eternall praiſe: Deut. 33.9 that in Gods cauſe he ſaid of his father and mother: <hi>I ſee him not, neither kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w he his bretheren, nor his owne children:</hi> euen ſo beloued, our eyes and our minds, &amp; deuotions, ſhould be ſo fixed and intent vpon God, when wee are in his ſeruice, that wee ſhould not ſee or regard any man in that while. And againe, we reade in the ſecond chapter of the Goſpell after S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelfe, who though he was the moſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull childe that euer was borne of woman, yet when hee was about his fathers buſineſſe, hee ſaith vnto his mother: <hi>Woman,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The third dutie of good manners, to bee obſerued in their geſture, is to ſtand while their betters are ſitting in place: example of this wee haue in holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the two ſtrangers, as it is written <hi>Gen.</hi>

And though wee finde no example for this in holy ſcripture, as beeing not vſed in thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: yet ſeeing the thing is ciuill and comely, and one of the ſpeciall curteſies of our daies, we will confirme it alſo with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Gods word: Phil. 4.8. <hi>Whatſoeuer things are honeſt whatſoeuer things are of good report, thoſe things do.</hi> And again, 1 Cor. 14, 40. <hi>Let all things be done decently, and according to order.</hi> But this kind of ciuilitie is both decent and according to order, as alſo honeſt and of good report: and therefore warranted and commended by Gods word, and ſo worthy to be followed. Therefore if our children bee not thus trained vp in nurture, while they be yong, when they be olde, they ſhall be found ſo head-ſtrong,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8506:144"/> that they will not be gouerned, but this conſequent muſt needes follow, that all order ſhall bee taken away, and then confuſion muſt needs enſue. For if nourture be neglected, then our elders and gouernours ſhall not bee reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced: if they be not reuerenced, they will not be regarded: if they be not regarded, they will not be obeyed: and if they be not obeyed, then ſteps in rebellion, and euery one will do what he liſteth.</p>
               <p>Theſe vices and great abuſes, are to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and with ſpeede amended, not onely of many parents and maiſters themſelues, but alſo that they labour with all diligence, that they may be redreſſed and amended in their children and ſeruants: firſt, the groſſe ignorance in the grounds of chriſtian religion, which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in any Parents, Maiſters, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, who giue themſelues to ſleepe in the church, to talke one with another, to turne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their bookes there, and vſing of their owne priuate deuotions or praiers, in the time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preaching and prayer, all which no doubt are greeuous ſinnes and tranſgreſſions: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many abſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſpecially vppon the Lords day, then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their beds, haunting of Ale-houſes and tauernes, riding and going abroad about their worldly affaires, for pleaſure and profit, beeing alſo wearie whilſt they be preſent at prayers and

And how ſhould wee looke for any goodneſſe from God, where this, that is the ſeede of all ſinne, and the nurſe of al abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions raigneth and ſwaieth ſo much?</p>
               <p>Let ſuch as are fathers and mothers, and haue children, know in what ſort they muſt be carefull for them. Their children are a good bleſſings of God, they be members of the body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Math. 16.14.</note> and the ſonnes of God. The kingdome of heauen belongeth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. God hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Angels to guide and leade them, and to ſhield them from euill: and their Angels bee in the preſence of God, and do behold the face of their father which is in heauen. They be freſh plants of the church. Who knoweth what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:8506:145"/> inſtruments they may be in the houſe of God? It is not ynough to feed them, to cloath them, &amp; to nouriſh their bodies with neceſſarie ſuſtenance.

The Aſſe though ſhe be dul, the Beare and Lyon, though they be wilde and cruell, yet ſeeke they far and neare, to get wherewith to helpe their young.

               <p>But in this behalfe, men are for the moſt part ouer-carefull. For this cauſe many builde their houſes with blood, and ſeeke poſſeſſions by iniquitie: they ioyne houſe to houſe, and field to field, and will dwell alone vpon the earth:<note place="margin">Eſay. 5.8.</note> they oppreſſe the poore and needie, and doe wrong to the Widdow and the fatherleſſe: they make money their God, and ſpoyle one another: and all to prouide for the children.

Vnhappy are ſuch fathers, which in this ſort care for their children,<note place="margin">Eſay. 33.1.</note> by the ruine and ſpoyle of the needie and innocent, and ſo breake the commandement of God: becauſe their

And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy are their children, becauſe they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their Fathers wickedneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall alſo be partakers of puniſhment with them.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 37.35.36.</note> The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: <hi>I haue ſeene the wicked ſtrong, and ſpreading himſelfe like a greene Baytree: Yet hee paſſed away, and loe, he was gone, and I ſought him, but hee could not be found.</hi> His roote was deepe, his ſtocke ſtrong, his braunches broad, hee ſpread ouer and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the whole countrie: yet he paſſed away.

               <p>Oh, how much better then is it, to furniſh the mindes of your children, and to inſtruct them in godlineſſe, to teach them to know God, to leade their life vertuouſly, and to rebuke them, and chaſtiſe them for ill dooing.</p>

               <p>A wiſe and louing father, which ſendeth his ſonne to a daungerous iourney, either by ſea or land: firſt inſtructeth him with aduiſe, and telleth him in what ſort he ſhall auoyde periles.

               <p>Now there bee ſome neceſſarie meanes and helpes, whereby godly parents may the more effectually and vertuouſly bring vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren according to the directions before ſpoken of, as theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, not to ſuffer their children and youth to haue their owne will. For <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, Prou. 11.20. <hi>They that are of a froward heart, are abomination vnto the Lord.</hi> And againe, in the 29. chapter, verſ. 15. <hi>A childe ſet at libertie, maketh his mother aſhamed.</hi> But what will ſome be readie to anſwere in this caſe? Oh hee may be broken of that time enough afterwards. But what ſaith the Wiſeman, Eccleſ. 25.27. <hi>Giue no paſſage to the waters, no not a little.</hi> The heart of a childe is as the violent waters. And as thoſe which haue experience in keeping and repairing the ſea bankes, can eaſily tell vs, that if the raging waues ſhould be ſuffered to break ouer but one tide, they ſhould hardly in many daies recouer it againe: ſo if thou ſuffereſt thy childes affections to haue the full ſwinge and courſe, yea but a ſmall ſeaſon, thou ſhalt hardly or neuer againe winne this breach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond meanes is, moderation in diet, not to pamper children with too much meate, or that which is delicate; but to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is holeſome and ſufficient, and no more. For exceſſe breedeth diſeaſes, both in bodie and minde, maketh them gluttons and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:8506:148"/> drunkards, conſumers of patrimonie, and this vice draweth a thouſand more with it: and euen as the fatteſt ſoyle bringeth foorth the rankeſt weedes; ſo pampered children brought vp without due gouernment and diſcipline, thruſt forth the greateſt and moſt ouergrowne vices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third helpe is, not to clothe them with coſtly apparell, or to attire them with new faſhions. For this againe is contray to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of paines and labour, and ſtirreth vp pride. For euen as the ſoft flaxe ſoone catcheth holde on the fire: ſo youthfull nature will ſoone bee inflamed with this vice, as lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too much teacheth at this day. For from whence commeth this diſguiſed &amp; monſtrous apparell, but from wanton and diſſolute edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of youth? This is the ſpeciall ſinne of England, and if any thing bee the ouerthrow of it (which God for his mercie turne away) it will be this: the land is too heauie of this ſinne. For the pride of al nations, and the follies of al coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are vpon vs, how ſhould wee long beare them? <hi>How art thou fallen from heauen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 14.12. Zeph. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>ô Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer, ſonne of the morning? And it ſhall be in the day of the Lords ſacrifice, that J wil viſit the Princes, and the Kings children, and all ſuch as are clothed with ſtrange apparell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth helpe is reprehenſion, or chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And this is taught, Prou. 29.15. <hi>The rod and correction giue wiſedome.</hi> Where by the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:8506:149"/> rod, is vnderſtood chaſtiſement; and by corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is vnderſtood, chiding or reprehenſion. The want of this helpe was the vtter ſpoile and vndoing of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> as may be ſeene 1. King. 1. &amp; 2. chapters. And here we cannot but iuſtly finde fault with moſt parents, who though they be ſomewhat carefull for their children while they be tender: yet when they be come to ſome yeares of diſcretion, as to fifteene or ſixteene, (which time is moſt fit for reprehenſion) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then by al reaſon it ſhould ſooneſt enter, and which time againe is moſt dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then our affections are moſt ſtrong in vs: oh then they be growne to mens and womens eſtate, they may not be reprehended, they may not be diſgraced. But know thou, oh wiſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that ſo long as thou haſt a childe, ſo long thou art a parent: and ſo long as thou art a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo long thou muſt carrie a fatherly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power ouer him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fift helpe is chaſtiſement, and it may well be called a helpe, becauſe where reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will not ſerue, that muſt helpe: and this muſt bee vſed in order and method, as the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Phiſition will not giue his ſtrong and bitter pill before his preparatiue, leaſt the working of it ſhould be hindered by the ſtubborne and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate obſtructions: ſo the wiſe parent in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſonnes vices, muſt not ſtrike before he hath reprehended or preadmoniſhed: leaſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8506:149"/> he bee too much caſt downe and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or waxe obſtinate. This kinde of phiſicke, as it is more ſtrong then the former, ſo it hath a more forcible and excellent working. For great is the godlineſſe in that ſeueritie, by which the power of ſinning is taken away. And againe, <hi>Salomon</hi> in the 22. of the Prouerbs, verſ. 15. ſaith more worthily: <hi>Fooliſhnes is bound in the hart of a childe, but the rod of correction ſhall driue it away.</hi> And againe in the 13. chapter, verſ. 24. <hi>He which ſpareth the rod, hateth his ſonne:</hi> that is, he is an enemie vnto him. Wherefore know thou this, O thou father, that when thou ſeeſt thy ſonne dangerouſly ſicke with the diſeaſe of ſinne, and doeſt not vſe this helpe and remedie, which God in his holie word hath preſcribed vnto thee, thou art acceſſarie to thy childes death, as an enemie, and his blood ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at thy hands: becauſe that where thou mighteſt haue ſaued him, thou haſt wilfullie caſt him away. For Gods loue (good parents) looke to your children. Oh that parents had leſſe naturall affection, or more wiſedome: for euery parent is blind in his owne children. Oh, is it not a pittifull thing, that parents ſhould themſelues make graues for their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and burie them quicke without all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and thinke they doe well in it? And is it not a follie aboue al follies, that while the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent layeth his hand vpon his childs mouth, to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:8506:150"/> keepe away the colde winde, hee preſſeth it down ſo hard, that he ſtrangleth him therwith? Thus many a father and mother in the world, haue killed their deare ones, by their inordinate loue and cockering of them, and thus manie poore infants muſt ſtill be murthered, becauſe parents will not be warned. Parents are bound by the law of nature to loue their children: for what a crueltie were it, not to loue them that they haue gotten and borne. But yet wiſedome requireth that they ſomewhat diſſemble and hide their loue (eſpecially to thoſe children that bee of ſome reaſonable diſcretion) leaſt they ſhould take boldnes thereupon to doe what they liſt.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 6.5. and 8.21. Matth. 15.19.</note> For if we well conſider of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is euill euen from his birth, we ſhall then finde the young childe which lieth in the cradle, to be both wayward and full of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which though his bodie bee but ſmall, yet he hath a great heart, and is altogether inclined to euill: and the more hee waxeth in reaſon by yeares, the more he groweth proude, froward, wilfull, vnruly, and diſobedient. If this ſparkle bee ſuffered to increaſe, it will rage ouer, and burne down the whole houſe. For we are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and become good, not by birth, but by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation. For like as planting and carefulneſſe hath great power in all growing things; euen ſo hath Education greater vertue and ſtrength: yea, and better fruit in the diligent bringing vp
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:8506:150"/> of children. Therefore parents muſt bee warie and circumſpect, that they neuer ſmile or laugh at any words or deedes of their children, done lewdly, vnhoneſtly, naughtily, wantonly, or ſhamefully, nor to kiſſe or commend them for ſo doing. For children will commonly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome themſelues vnto ſuch things, as they ſhal ſee and perceiue to bee pleaſing, and delightfull to their father and mother. Therefore they muſt correct, and ſharply reproue their children, for ſaying or doing ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make it knowne vnto them, that they be neither wel pleaſed, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their ſo doing, but that it greatlie diſliketh them. And againe, on the other ſide, let them kiſſe and make much of them, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they ſhal ſee or heare them do any thing that is a ſigne of goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>But ſuch is the fond and too much cockering affection of ſome parents towards their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that there is more neede in theſe daies, to teach and admoniſh them not to loue them too much, then to perſwade them to loue them. For <hi>Dauids darling,</hi> was <hi>Dauids traytor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 15. all, and 18.33.</note> And this is the maner of God and his iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that when any father or mother begins (as it were) to ſet their childe, or any thing els, in the roome of God, and ſo loue the ſame aboue him which gaue it, either to take away the child, or the thing, or els to take away the parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they prouoke him too much. For as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:8506:151"/> the Ape doth with too much embracings, well neere kill her young whelpes: ſo likewiſe, ſome vndiſcreet parents, through immoderate loue and ouer-much pampering and cheriſhing, do vtterly ſpoyle and marre their children. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if parents would haue their children liue, they muſt take heede that they loue them not too much: for the giuer is diſpleaſed when the gift is more eſteemed then he.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ill bringing vp, is a cauſe of marring many which are of a good toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wit.</note>We may ſee by experience, how that many children of good wit and towardneſſe, are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſpoyled for want of good education, and ſo get thoſe vices from their tender yeares, which all their life after doe for the moſt part accompanie them. For when parents doe either too much cocker their children, or by their lewd example allure them to naughtineſſe, or neglect due inſtruction: what other thing (I pray you) can come to paſſe, then which wee ſee in trees, which from the beginning being neglected, become crooked and vnfruitfull. Contrariwiſe, they that are pruned, erected, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and watered with the hand and cunning of the Husbandman, are made ſtraight, fertile, and fruitfull. So that the manner of life, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cuſtome, are of great importance to moue to vertue. What a great follie is it in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to toyle themſelues and bee occupied in getting riches, and to bee nothing carefull for their children, for whoſe ſake riches are gotten?
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:8506:151"/> Aſſuredly there can none more precious and better heritage bee left vnto children, then if they bee well and vertuouſly brought vp from their tender age, and be rightly inſtructed vnto vertue from their infancie. This patrimonie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth with them continually, nothing at all ſubiect to the ſtormes and troubles of fortune. But wee ſee two ſpeciall cauſes,<note place="margin">Two things which much hinder good education.</note> why ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents doe more negligently prouide that their children be inſtructed: to wit, too much cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and niggardſhip.</p>
               <p>In cockering, mothers do more often offend, and eſpecially thoſe which haue but few chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Theſe doe like as if ſome Husband man ſhould refuſe to till his field becauſe hee hath but one onely. Who could ſuffer this mans fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and peruerſeneſſe of iudgement? Is it not much more to be tilled, becauſe it is onely one? Yes verely, that ſo the profit and increaſe of one, may recompence the want of many: euen ſo, after the ſame ſort wee iudge it to bee the dutie of mothers, ſo much more diligently to bring vp their children, by how much they are fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. But wee ſee what doth let mothers,<note place="margin">The fewer the children, the more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be cared for, that they bewel brought vp.</note> that they loue their children more dearely, then that they can ſuffer them to be an houre out of their ſight: but this is cruel loue ſo to loue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they ſhould bee as it were giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of their mothers vnto all naughtineſſe, of which peruerſe and cruell loue, not a fewe

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe, which hindereth good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>On the other ſide, niggardſhip is oftentimes greater, then that parents will beſtow the coſt. Whatſoeuer is ſpent vpon horſe-keepers, or horſe-breakers, fooles, minſtrels, dogs, hawkes, &amp;c. that ſome thinke well beſtowed: but if they ſee any thing to be ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about inſtructing their children, they thinke all that ill beſtowed, and are much more carefull that an horſe bee well framed to vauting and leaping, then that their childe bee well inſtructed to vertue. This inconuenience commeth to the minds of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if they bee not well brought vp, that they become ſeruile, and open to all ſin and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines. For if a man leaue his field vntilled, hee ſhall finde it to haue brought forth fearne and thiſtles, and ſuch vnprofitable weedes: after the ſame ſort, if he ſhall leaue the wittes of his children vnlooked vnto, and vnexerciſed, hee ſhall be ſure to reape moſt aboundant fruite of wantonnes and vngratiouſnes.</p>
               <p>The holie Ghoſt ſpeaking in the Scriptures of fooliſh ſonnes; as that he that begetteth ſuch a one, getteth himſelfe ſorrow, and that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a foole hath no ioy: Prou. 17.21. mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:8506:152"/> it not ſo much of naturall fooles or idiots, and ſuch as are deſtitute of common reaſon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is true, that is a lamentable iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, and a heauineſſe to the parents of ſuch a childe: as of wicked children, ſuch as either are ignorant in the word, or not knowing how to order one right ſteppe to the kingdome of God: or els hauing ſome knowledge, abuſe it to maintaine their carnall luſts and appetite. For this cauſe, as it would griue parents to haue naturall fooles to their children, or ſuch as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſome imperfection of nature are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, or deformed, and misfigured in the parts of their bodie: ſo much more ſhould it grieue them to haue ſuch children, as either for want of knowledge and heauenly wiſedome, cannot walke in the feare of God; or abuſing the knowledge giuen them, proſtitute and giue themſelues to all ſinne and wickedneſſe: it is marueilous how greatly parents can bewaile the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of one naturall gift proceeding of ſome imperfection, and how eaſily they can paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without any griefe, the want of all ſpirituall graces, ſpringing from corrupt education.</p>
               <p>In like maner is it ſtrange, that men can take the matter ſo heauilie, when their children breake into ſuch offences, as either haue open ſhame, or ciuill puniſhment following them: and yet can make no bones, but paſſe ouer ſuch ſins as are againſt the maieſtie of God, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

Wherein what doth the moſt part of men bewray, but their great hypocriſie, in that neither their ioy, nor their griefe is found to their children, and that they loue themſelues more in their children, then either their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the glorie of God: the tender loue and care whereof (no doubt) did increaſe the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of <hi>Dauid,</hi> for the death of his ſonne <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>

Let parents therefore learne to correct their affections to their children, and bee grieued for their ignorance, impietie, and ſinnes, whereof either their carnall copulation, the not lamenting of their naturall corruption, the want of prayer and holie ſeede, or prophane education, armed with the wrath of God, may be a moſt iuſt occaſion. Can parents hope for a holie poſteritie? or doe they maruell if the Lord croſſe them in the children of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when they make as bolde and brutiſh an entrance into that holie ordinance of the Lord, as is the meeting of the neighing horſe with his mare: when being ioyned in that honourable eſtate of matrimonie, either as meere naturall men, without all knowledge of God, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

               <p>Laſtly, when hauing receiued the fruit of the wombe, they haue no care, by good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bringing vp, to offer it to the Lord, that their childe by carnall generation, may bee the childe of God by ſpirituall regeneration. Surely no: and yet men looking vp to God his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſecret counſell, without all bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues of their corrupt generation, from which their children are deſcended, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all looking backe into their wicked and godleſſe bringing of them vp, will fret againſt their ſinnes, fume againſt their children: yea, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they wil correct them, and that to ſerue their owne corruptions, not ſo much grieued for that they haue ſinned againſt God, as that they haue offended them. Chriſtians therfore muſt know, that when men and women raging with boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling luſt, meete together as brute beaſts, hauing no other reſpect, then to ſatisfie their own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall concupiſcence, when they make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſanctifie the marriage bedde with prayer, when they haue no care to increaſe the Church of Chriſt, and the number of the elect, it is the iuſt iudgement of God to ſend them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Againe on the contrarie, wee ſhall finde in the word of God, that noble and notable men commended vnto vs, for rare examples of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and godlineſſe, were children asked and obtained of God by prayer.<note place="margin">Gene. 4.2.25.</note> Our firſt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> being humbled after the birth of their wicked ſonne <hi>Caine,</hi> obtained a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Abel:</hi> of whom, when by his bloodie bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were bereft, they receiued that holie man <hi>Seth.

               <p>Looke what ſinnes parents haue receiued naturally without God his great bleſſing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer and humbling of themſelues, they

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord graunteth ſometimes ciuill gifts vnto the children of naturall and carnall men: yet for the moſt part they receiue their naturall ſinnes. But if the children of God by regeneration, doe ſee in themſelues, and lament their ſinnes of generation, praying that their naturall corruptions may be preuented in their poſterities; they ſhall ſee the great mercies of God in ſome meaſure, freeing their children from the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now when thou ſhalt ſee ſuch ſinnes to be in thy children, enter into thine owne hart, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy ſelfe whether they are not come from thee: conſider how iuſtly the hand of GOD may bee vpon thee: and when thou wouldeſt be angrie againſt thy childe, haue an holy anger with thy ſelfe, and vſe this, and ſuch like medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with thine owne ſoule: Lord, ſhal I thus puniſh mine owne ſinne, and that in mine own childe? ſhall I thus perſecute the corruptions of my anceſtors? nay, I ſee (O Lord) and proue, that thou art diſpleaſed with mee, for the too carnall conception of my childe: I lay then in ſome ſinne, I asked it not of thee by prayer: bee mercifull vnto mee (O Lord) and in thy good time ſhew ſome pitie vpon my childe.</p>

                  <hi>Iacob,</hi> thou ſhalt bee ſo affected, as deſirous to draw thy child out of ſinne, yet with the mildeſt meanes and leaſt rigor. And one thing is moſt wonderfull; that ſome will teach their children to ſpeake corruptly, and doe wickedly whileſt they are young, and yet beate them for it when they are old. Againe, ſome will imbolden their little ones to practiſe iniquitie towards others, which when by the iuſt iudgement of God, they afterwards exerciſe towards the parents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they are corrected for it. And yet deale with theſe, and ſuch like men, for the euill edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their children, and they will anſwere: Doe not wee, as much as is of vs required? wee ſend our children to the church to be inſtructed of the Paſtor: and to the ſchoole to bee taught of the maſter: if they learne, it will be the better for them: if not, they haue the more to anſwer for: what can we doe more? But remember, O man: conſider, O woman, whoſoeuer thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, for that ſins ſake, and the want of prayer, there may be a plague vpon the Paſtors paines, and a curſe vpon the teachers trauell.</p>

And here let parents be admoniſhed of their vndiſcreet correction, who doe their children more harme, in ſhewing a merrie countenance, after their diſcipline vſed, then they doe good by their chaſtiſement of them, whiles they doe correct them.

               <p>To be briefe, how needfull houſehold go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is towards children, may appeare by the ſlender thriuing, &amp; ſmal profiting either of religion or vertue, either in the Church or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Wherefore, not ſpeaking of election, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, which we leaue onely to the Lord, to make good or bad: we exhort parents to vſe the ordinary meanes to bring vp their children, ſo as they, either by ſome good tokens may ſee them the children of God, and heyres of the couenant, or at leaſt be comforted in their own conſcience: if their children for ſome cauſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne refuſe it, in that to the vttermoſt of their abilitie, they haue vſed all good and godly meanes to bring them vp well, &amp; offered them to God.</p>
               <p>And if parents haue cauſe to bee grieued, when thus trauelling in good education, they cannot ſee good in their children, how much more cauſe of griefe may they haue, when they haue vſed &amp; beſtowed no labour at all, to bring them vp in the feare of the Lord? And yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will be grieued for the one, that will not for the other. Wherefore let vs learne, if we wiſh to conuey God his bleſſings to our poſterities,

               <p>One of the principalleſt duties that belong to parents towards their children, is, that they be very warie and carefull,<note place="margin">Marriage with Papiſts, &amp;c.</note> that their ſonnes and daughters doe not match in marriage, with ſuch as are vngodly, wicked, and voyd of true religion.

And how can he then permit, that wee ſhould marrie with them? He commandeth ſtraightly: that we ſhould not draw in one yoke with the vnbeleeuing. 2.

               <p>Parents haue further to remember, that they haue not this rule and authority ouer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they may chuſe whether they will let them marrie or no, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they liſt, and whom they liſt; but fathers and mothers muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that they haue rule ouer their children vnder the Lord, ſo that the Lord is aboue them: and therefore parents muſt deale with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren according to the will and minde of God, which will of God is reuealed vnto vs out of his word.</p>

If therefore Parents by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhould teach the contrary, what do they elſe but indeuour to tranſforme me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into beaſts, beginning firſt to performe it in their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?

And let Parents alway labour, that their children may rather feare them, for loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, then for feare of puniſhment. For chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that obey their Parents for feare of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſuch commonly feare them no longer, then the ſtripes endureth.<note place="margin">As the father beginneth, ſo it is like the ſonne wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</note> Before all things, it is needfull that Parents ſhould ſhew themſelues vnto their children, as a manifeſt patterne or example, not only by not ſinning and offending God any waies: but alſo by liuing godly, and by doing all things honeſtly, that ſo their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may looke into their liues, &amp; peruſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as in a glaſſe. And therefore, if Parents do giue good examples,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.</note> they ſhall reape the fruit thereof, on the life, behauiour, manners, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of their children. For children loue and delight to do, as their Parents did before them.</p>
               <p>All chriſtian fathers ought to be very careful, in nouriſhing and maintaining naturall loue and concord, amongſt the children and familie,

For the ſtate of a familie, if it be in due order, is like to a frame of ioyning worke, or building, whereof, if ſome one peece be out of his place, it tendeth to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordering of all the reſt: and one diſorder follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another, all bee commeth out of ioynt, and falleth vnto confuſion very diſpraiſable. So that Parents therefore ought to be carefull to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their children in peace, concord and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For if diſcord and contention be daungerous and pernitious among al men, how much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betweene brethren and ſiſters? Likewiſe, if it be hard quenching of ſtomacke and debate, betweene thoſe that are not conioyned in kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, it is farre more difficult to reunite brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, becauſe enmitie among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is mightie and ſtrong, like Iron barres to keepe them aſunder. Neyther is there any thing more ſlipperie or of greater efficacie to ſubuert a familie, then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention among brethren. It is an olde ſaying: by concord ſmall things do growe, but by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord great things come to nought. Againe, how daungerous it is for Parents to ſhew more loue and affection to one childe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another, except vppon iuſt and great cauſe, the example of <hi>Iacobs</hi> children doth teſtifie. For what was

Parents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the end to preuent like inconueniences, are to vſe equalitie among their children ſo neere as may bee, whether in their ordinarie vſage, or in the diuiſion of their goods. For all men naturally are inclined, but too much to the loue of earthly goods: ſo the vnequall ſharing and diuiding of the ſame, doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times breed great braules &amp; pernitious debate betweene brethren and ſiſters. Therefore all fathers and mothers are with great diligence, to take heed what they ſay or do in their houſes and that they doe not commit any lewde or wicked deed, whereby their children may bee moued to imitate and follow the ſame: neither that they vtter or ſpeake any bawdy or ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous words, or vſe to ſweare, or lye, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: for euill ſpeakings or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication (ſaith the Apoſtle) corrupteth good maners.<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Further, Parents ought to bee circumſpect and warie, that their children doe not haunt or vſe euill company, or vſe any vnhoneſt paſtime.

By the ancient law of the Iewes, the eldeſt had double ſo much as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the fathers goods, and alone to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt pertained the bleſſing of the father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhould ſeeme alwaies the heritage to goe and ſucceede: as is manifeſt by the wil of God, in Deuter. 31.15, 16, 17. <hi>If a man haue two wiues, one loued, and another hated, and they haue borne him children, both the loued, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the hated: if the firſt borne be the ſonne of the hated, then when the time commeth, that hee appointeth his ſonnes to bee heires of that which hee hath, hee may not make the ſonne of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued first borne, before the ſonne of the hated, which is the first borne: but he ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſonne of the hated, which is the first borne, and giue him double portion of all that hee hath: for hee is the first of his ſtrength,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8506:173"/> and to him belongeth the right of the firſt borne.</hi> The Patriarkes, and others the ſeruants of God, although by diuine reuelation and other notice of the will of God, they were certified that they might marrie many or ſundrie wiues at one time, yet did they exclude from their heritage and prerogatiue of the bleſſing, all the children of thoſe ſecondarie and after mariages. This appeareth in Gen. 21.10. <hi>The ſonne of the bond woman ſhall not be heire with my ſonne Iſaack:</hi> yet was hee the eldeſt, but was not the ſonne of the firſt mariage. Alſo an heire, is the work and inſtitution of nature, and heritage is due to the ſonne by nature, therefore it is ſo due that hee muſt needs haue it: ſeeing thoſe things which come by nature, or be natural, are not mutable or to bee changed. Moreouer this name Heire, which in maner with all Nations is the eldeſt, he is the ſucceſſor of the law Nationall, beſides the lawes natural and diuine. And that father, who maketh another heire then is by theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities appointed, cannot but expreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a rebell, in diſobeying and contemning ſo great lawes and authorities, beginning a new law of his owne head contrary thereunto. Then what is more vniuſt, then to doe contrary to all lawes, and therwith to diſobey the will of God, to peruert the due order of diſcent, preferring the ſecond mariage before the firſt, the yonger before the elder, the late offpring before the firſt

Now as the greateſt iniurie a father can do to his ſon, is to diſherit him: ſo is it the moſt reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blot or dammage, to ſuffer the infamie and diſcredit of diſheriſon.

               <p>By this word <hi>Honor,</hi> is alſo ſignified the loue, reuerence, dutie, obedience, ſubiection, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and neceſſarie aſſiſtance that childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> owe to their parents. As concerning the loue, the ſummarie of the ſecond Table, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in theſe words: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe,</hi> doth manifeſtly confirme it.<note place="margin">Matth. 22.39.</note> For who can be a neerer neighbour for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to loue, then their parents?</p>
               <p>Beſides that, they are not to bee loued onely as neighbours proceeding of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> but alſo as fathers and mothers. And therefore what ingratitude is it, not to loue thoſe of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, next after God, they haue their life and being, together with many great and continual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits towards them? Alſo the loue that parents doe beare to their children, beſides ſo many their labours, ſorowes, troubles, and vexations, ſhould binde them reciprocally to loue them.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:8506:175"/> The Sunne ſhining a while vpon the cold ſtones doth ſo heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thay they yeeld ſome warmth: ſo albeit that children bee as hard and colde as ſtones, yet the experience, and the daily feeling of the loue of their parents towards them, ought mightily to inflame their hearts to loue them againe. Take away the beame from the Sunne, and it will not ſhine; the ſprings from the riuer, and it will drie vp; the bough from the tree, and it will wither; the member from the body, and it will rot. And ſo take from children their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to their parents, and they are no longer chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but brethren and companions with thoſe vnto whom Ieſus Chriſt ſaid: <hi>Ye are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the diuell.</hi> Ioh. 8.44.</p>
               <p>This band of the loue of children towards their parents, ſhould take ſuch place, not onely toward ſuch parents as are louing and gentle, but alſo (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of the duties of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to their maſters) euen toward ſuch as bee rigorous. For if we ought to loue all the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Adam,</hi> euen thoſe whom wee know not, or our enemies and perſecutors: how much rather our parents, albeit they ſhuld intreate vs rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with rigour, either in word or deede? and verily the principal cauſe ſtil abideth: namely, that they be our father and mother. This ought children well to note, to the end that patiently bearing their reprehenſions, reproofes, and in generall, whatſoeuer their troubleſome and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:8506:175"/> ſharpe affections, they may ſtill continue and declare their childlike affection and loue. And to that purpoſe children muſt remember the labour, griefe, anguiſh, weeping, ſorow, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubleſome cares, that their parents do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide and indure for them.</p>
               <p>This loue muſt bee accompanied with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect: &amp; to ſay the truth,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.9.</note> albeit the name of father belongeth properly vnto God, as Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: <hi>You haue but one father, euen him that is in heauen.</hi> Yet doth he ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it to thoſe that haue begotten vs, that they being called fathers, do beare the title &amp; image of God. And this is it that bindeth children to reſpect and honour them, and to teſtifie the ſame by their outward reuerence. Of this reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we haue a notable example in <hi>Salomon:</hi> hee vnderſtanding that his mother <hi>Berthſheba</hi> was comming to ſpeake with him,<note place="margin">1. King. 2.19.</note> aroſe from his ſeate, came to meete her, bowed before her, and ſet her vpon his right hand. Neither could his greatnes, neither his royall eſtate priuiledge him from this reſpect &amp; honour due to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But when the ſonne doth execute his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie, or publike office, he is greater then his father, and muſt beare himſelfe as a Magiſtrate, not as a ſonne: but when hee is out of place, or execution of office, he muſt (how highly ſoeuer he be aduanced) haue a reſpect, and yeeld reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his parents. But many times it falleth
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:8506:176"/> out otherwiſe: for many children when they come to honour, or wealth, do deſpiſe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, if they bee of meaner calling then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that hardly they will acknowledge, or call them father, as if they were aſhamed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that that man putteth off the affection of a childe to his father, who by the eminencie of an office ouer him, quencheth the name of a ſon. But <hi>Salomon</hi> forgat not himſelfe in this kind of dutie, for he did not onely bow before his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as is aforeſaid, but alſo called her mother: ſaying,<note place="margin">1. King. 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Mother, aske, and J will not denie thee.</hi> And this doe we the rather note alſo vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, namely, that his example co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth the cuſtome of theſe daies, wherein this name of father and mother is accounted ſo baſe &amp; contemptible, that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of kings, princes, yea euen of mean gentlemen, ſpeaking to their parents, muſt not ſay, father, mother: but Sir, my Lord, my Ladie, Madam, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But the due honour to parents that we here ſpeake of, implieth not onely this outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, but alſo that wee ſhould ſo eſteeme of them, as that neither our ſelues ſhould deſpiſe them, neither ſhould wee ſuffer others to haue them in contempt. And this are wee to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in the ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Iohn 8.49.</note> 
                  <hi>I honour my father, but you diſhonor me.</hi> He there defendeth the honour of his father, againſt the falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and ſlanders of the Iewes. But ſome there
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:8506:176"/> are ſo vnnaturall and peruerſe, that forgetting all due reuerence and reſpect to their parents, they will not onely deſpiſe them in their owne hearts, and ſuffer others to ſpeake hardly of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but alſo will themſelues ſo farre exceede, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to lay them open to the ſcorne of others.</p>

               <p>Alſo children muſt bee carefull to follow the good examples of their fathers &amp; mothers, and to ſuffer themſelues to bee gouerned by them, and to bee mindfull to beſtow all paine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to diſcharge their dutie towards them: and herewithall they muſt know, that they are not at their owne libertie to doe as they liſt, ſo long as they haue a father and mother to rule them: and not to fall out among themſelues,<note place="margin">Pſal. 133.1.</note> but mutually to loue and helpe one another.</p>
               <p>And yet children haue alwaies to remember, that they may not in any caſe obey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when they ſhall commaund them to doe or ſay any thing that is contrarie to the word of God.

For the duties of the firſt table, are alwaies to be preferred before the duties of the ſecond table. This ſubiection therefore that children owe vnto their fathers, ought in verie deede to bee vnto them as a ladder, or ſtaier,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.9.</note> to leade them to the reuerence and obedience of God, who is our chiefe father.</p>
               <p>As children receiue of their parents three things: to wit, <hi>life, maintenance,</hi> &amp; <hi>inſtruction:</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:8506:178"/> ſo for theſe three they owe other three, namely, for <hi>life,</hi> they owe <hi>loue:</hi> for <hi>maintenance,</hi> they owe <hi>obedience:</hi> for <hi>instruction,</hi> they owe <hi>reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> For their life, they muſt feruently loue their parents: for their maintenance, they muſt dutifully obey their parents, as maſters: and for their inſtruction, they muſt cheerefully reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their parents as their Tutors.</p>
               <p>And further, children muſt remember, that the Lord hath giuen to them their parents, to take of them their beginning of life, and that they might nouriſh and bring them vp: and of rude, and almoſt brutiſh things, they might make them able to helpe &amp; liue of themſelues: yea, and ſuch mothers as are godly and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, doe ſuffer and endure more paine &amp; griefe in the bearing, bringing vp, and nouriſhing of their children, then the fathers do. So that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are the pleaſures and good turnes, that chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian parents do for their children, greater is the coſt and labour that they beſtow on them, and greater is the care, griefe, and trouble, which they take for them, then any man, how learned ſo euer he be, is able to expreſſe. And therefore if there were no other reaſons or cauſes to moue children greatly to loue, to eſteeme well, to obey, to be kinde, faithfull, and dutifull, and to reuerence their parents, and that with ſuch a reuerence as commeth from the hart: yet theſe were ſufficient.</p>

               <p>Maides and young women are to be put in minde, and alwaies to remember, that the beſt portion, the greateſt inheritance, and the moſt precious iewell that they can bring them on their mariage day, is Shamefaſtneſſe: the want whereof is moſt hurtfull in all women. And therefore they muſt carefully ſhunne and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide all idle and wanton talke, nice lookes, dalliance, and light countenance, when they walke abroad, or bee in companie.

               <p>Children may not forget this dutie, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receyued their being from their parents, and being brought vp by them, with great paines &amp; much coſt, they ſhould not therefore ſo much as giue any liking, much leſſe ſpeech of marrige, without the conſent of parents, or of thoſe which are ſet ouer them by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: the dutie of thankfulneſſe requiring it at
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:8506:180"/> their hands, and not onely in regard of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, is this dutie to bee performed to their parents, but euen in regard of their owne ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, as being not experienced in ſuch things, and their wits being not ſo ripe as their parents, they wanting wiſedome and diſcretion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelues as they ought. For ſome chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren know not what are meet and conuenient for them, nor whether they be of meet age and condition to marrie. Which inabilitie being in the ſonnes, is much more in the daughters, as being the weaker by nature, and more vnable to prouide for themſelues, and therefore it is neceſſarie, that they ſhould not marrie without the conſent and direction of their parents, but to be at their beſtowing: for, to doe otherwiſe is a ſinne, euen that nature it ſelfe abhorreth: and all ſound Writers, old and new, doe vtterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow.<note place="margin">It is a ſweet wedding, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father and the mother bring a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the feaſt: and a heauie vnion, which is curſed the firſt day that it is knit.</note> And for ſo much as marriage being the meanes, the which God himſelfe hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſanctified for the propagation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of mankind, that being taken in hand in his feare, a godly ſeed being multiplied &amp; gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vp here on earth, the ſame may be bleſſed to the conſtitution and making of a Church, the which may ſerue him in holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes: when the ſame is taken in hand, with the breach of his commandement, ſo far off is it, that any bleſſing is to be hoped for, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, his hot indignation, wrath and heauy curſe hangeth ouer that houſe &amp; familie, where
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:8506:181"/> the parties, which are the principall pillers and vpholders of the ſame, are linked and tyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in ſuch a band of wedlocke, whoſe links and incloſings, are not faſtned &amp; coupled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the neceſſary &amp; lawful aſſent &amp; liking of the parents, whoſe authoritie and conſent; ought to beare the chiefeſt ſway, and ſtrike like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the greateſt ſtroke, in this moſt holy and heauenly action. And likewiſe as marriage, that is begunne and enterpriſed in the feare of God, according to his word, there God is well pleaſed, there the parties ſo matched, liue togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ioyfull agreement, and linking the one to the other: there God is honoured, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſinceritie and trueth: there the children, when God giueth them, with the reſt of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, are inſtructed and brought vp in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of religion, and grounds of faith: ſo on the other ſide, the regard of that which God eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially commandeth, being ſhut out of our marriages, there muſt needs enſue his diſlike, and diſpleaſure: there is iarre and diſcord: there Gods honour is neglected: there houſehold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and chriſtian inſtruction of ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto our charge, goeth vtterly to wracke, and is nothing at all regarded. And no maruel: for, if where God bleſſeth, all things goe well, and doe proſper: then conſequently, where hee curſeth, there nothing thriueth, hath good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, or goeth happily forward. It may appeare by ſundry examples, both before the Law was
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:8506:181"/> giuen, and after, that this is a dutie required of children towards their parents: namely, to haue their conſent in contracting of marriage. As theſe places doe plainely ſhew:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.17.</note> Gen. 21.21. and 24.3. &amp;c. and 21.1.2. and 29.19. and 34.4. Deut. 7.3.4. Iudg. 14.1. &amp;c. 1. Cor. 7.36.38. Whereby is manifeſtly proued, that firſt it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of nature.

Deut. 15.12.</note> more then they haue ouer their ſeruants. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe children are their fathers goods &amp; riches, and therefore they muſt not beſtow themſelues in marriage, but muſt be beſtowed of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Fourthly, for that parents haue authoritie ouer the vowes of their children, Numb. 30.4. 5, 6. Fiftly, if a mans daughter be inticed;<note place="margin">Contracts voyd, without the conſent of parents.</note> yet her father may refuſe, being not auaileable, or of any force, without his conſent. Exod. 22.16.17. Beſides all this, what cleerer proofe can we haue, then the fift commandement, in the which children are commanded to honor their fathers and mothers, with a bleſſing promiſed to thoſe which performe the ſame: whereby we gather by the nature of contraries, that there is a curſe alſo belonging to all thoſe children, that ſhall diſhonour them. And in that God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that the parents by their children ſhould be honoured, he meaneth, that they ſhould in all humilitie and modeſtie reuerence them, with all dutifull ſubmiſſion be obedient vnto them, and with all willingneſſe, ſhew themſelues
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:8506:182"/> thankefull for their creation, education, ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and all other benefits, that vnder God they haue receiued from them, being readie by all meanes they poſſibly may, to imitate and expreſſe towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of the Storke, whoſe propertie (as they write of them) is to prouide meat &amp; feed their dams, when through age they grow ſo old, that they are not able for to helpe themſelues: that is to ſay, they muſt to their very vtmoſt ſeeke to make them recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and requitall, of ſome part of thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requitable paines, the which their louing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents haue taken with them, and make ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the vncounteruailable kindnes that they haue ſhewed towards them. But where they beſtow themſelues in marriage, without the conſent of their parents, there they do fault, and make a breach of dutie, in all theſe three reſpects: that is to ſay, they neither reuerence, obey, nor ſhew themſelues thankful vnto them. For reuerence conſiſteth in this, that children carrie towards their parents, a certaine honeſt, and modeſt ſhamefaſtnes, ioyned with a baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full awefulnes &amp; ſtanding in feare of them, the which worketh in them, a conceiuing of ſuch an opinion and eſtimation of them, as that they haue an eſpecial reſpect and regard of them, in doing or not doing of things, neither of a care to pleaſe them, or of a feare to offend them. Obedience herein ſheweth forth it ſelfe, in that willingly without murmuring or grudging,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:8506:182"/> they be willing to be ordered, directed, guided and ruled, by their parents, being ready to doe all lawfull things, the which they commaund them, and to refraine from all thoſe things, the which they ſhall forbid them. Thankfulneſſe, beſides that there are many other branches, is alwayes mindful of benefits receiued, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carrieth continually a vigilant and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye towards the partie by whom it hath bin pleaſured, that no diſcourteſie in any caſe be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or any occaſion miniſtred, whereby hee may conceiue vnkindnes. And by this familiar diſcription of theſe three heads, wherof ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth chiefely, the honor due vnto parents: we may cleerely ſee, that thoſe children which in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tarrie not for the conſent of their fathers and mothers, doe neither ſtand in any awfull feare of them, as alſo whom they would be loth to offend or diſpleaſe, nor yet giue ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in all things to be gouerned and aduiſed by them, or haue any regard, that they bee not cauſers to make their friends or parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hardly and vnkindly of them, when as it is more then manifeſt, that in matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their dutie towards their parents, no griefe cutteth neerer vnto the heart, then this, when their children entangle themſelues contrary to their mind and liking. And therefore ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as match in this ſort, as it were in ſpight of the teeth of their fathers &amp; mothers, are neither reuerent, obedient, nor thankful vnto them, and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:8506:183"/> ſo conſequently, they doe not honour them, whereby they incurre and runne into the curſe of God, the which muſt without true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance, pull downe vpon the heads of themſelues and their families, the fearefull plagues of God his heauy and hot indignation againſt them, to their vtter ſubuerſion, decay and ruine. Let all dutifull and good natured children, therefore in the reuerence and feare of God, conſider, what honor, and obedience they doe owe vnto their parents, and what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie hee hath in his word ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnto them, ouer their children in the Lord: in regard hereof, let them yeeld vnto them this dutie, that their fathers hauing prouided for them,<note place="margin">Children ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riageable, are to pray vnto God to direct their parents in a godly choiſe, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their minds to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the ſame.</note> ſuch as are not of a wicked life, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or euil fauoured, nor of a contrary reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they willingly ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto their choiſe, which if for the preſent, or vpon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, they cannot yeeld vnto, let them by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt calling vpon the name of God, not onely deſire him to direct their parents in a godly and fit choiſe, but alſo to ſubdue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this corrupt affection, and to frame their wils to bee pliable vnto their fathers in ſuch lawfull caſes.

               <p>And to the end to inuite and ſtirre vp chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to honour their parents, as before is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.12.

For albeit there bee a promiſe added to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, yet is the ſame common vnto the whole law: but this is peculiar and eſpeciall, to all ſuch children as honour their parents: for herein hath God declared how highly he commendeth the obedience and honour that children yeeld to them. But the Lord ſpake to the Iſraelites pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the land, that he had promiſed them for an inheritance, which ſhould be vnto them as a teſtimonie and ſeale of his goodnes and loue toward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And hereupon doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ioyne togither theſe two ſentences: <hi>That it may goe well with thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 6.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and that thou mayeſt liue long vpon the earth.</hi> As alſo when God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away ſuch obedient children before they be old: yea, before they come vnto mans ſtate, whether it be, leaſt malice ſhould corrupt their hearts, or to preuent ſome great calamities, wherein they might peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture be entangled: or vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatſoeuer other conſiderations, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:8506:185"/> them into a better life, he doth faithfully performe his promiſe vnto ſuch children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he dealeth better then promiſe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But as contrariwiſe, this promiſe threatneth ſuch children as will not honor their parents, with ſhort life: ſo doth experience declare, that many ſuch children are of ſhort and wretched life. But if contrariwiſe, ſuch diſobedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe chance to liue long, ſo far is long life from being vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a bleſſing, that to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is an enforcement and increaſe of woe, becauſe they enlarge their iuſt conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, ſo as they had beene better to haue died in their youth. But howſoeuer it bee, God ſo diſpoſeth hereof, that by the effects we may perceiue, that they which honor their parents are bleſſed, and the others accurſed. Eccle. 3.2 &amp;c. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do not performe thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towards their children, inioyned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Lord: yet ſuch children as liue wickedly, muſt know, that they are not exempt and free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blame, &amp; guiltines before God. For though they can ſay, (as the children in <hi>Ezechiels</hi> time ſaid:) <hi>The fathers haue eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge:</hi> we ſay, that though the occaſion be offered of ſuch vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wicked parents, yet the cauſe of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ſtill in the children themſelues. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, it is ſure, that the ſoule that hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhall die the death. Seeing there be ſome yong men &amp; maids, who notwithſtanding the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:8506:185"/> great prophaneneſſe of the moſt, the manifold corruptions offered abroad, the vngodly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples abounding at home, are ſo mightily preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the ſeed of grace, that they eſcape ſafely in an holy courſe of life, lamenting when they ſee the leaſt occaſion of euill, reioycing in the leaſt occaſion of good things. The reſt, who pleaſe themſelues, and hope to ſhelter their ſins vnder their parents defaults, are plainely left without excuſe, &amp; are iuſtly guiltie of the blood of their owne ſinnes. Labour therefore ye yong men and maidens, to wipe away the teares of griefe from your fathers eies, &amp; ſtay the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; ſorrowful ſpirits of your tender mothers, and conſider in your ſelues, if yee haue any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in you, &amp; haue not buried the vſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, what a ſhame it is, to be a ſhame vnto your fathers, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye ought to be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: thinke, ye wanton wits, that haue not caſt off all naturall affections, what a contempt it is, to be a contempt vnto your mothers, to whom you haue offered, as it were, a deſpightfull vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in that yee are a corroſiue to her griefe, when as ye ſhould haue bin a crowne vnto her comforts. Learne therefore ye children, that it is one ſpecial propertie of a liberal &amp; ingenious nature, to bee careful ſo to liue, that in time yee may be a glory to your fathers, &amp; a ioy to your mothers: which the Lord for his Chriſts ſake grant. Theſe precepts &amp; admonitions before ſaid, are as a Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marie of the duties of children to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:8506:186"/> their parents. And therefore it reſteth, that they vnderſtanding them, doe pray vnto God to giue them grace, to put them in practiſe to his glory, and their good and ſaluation. Laſtly, let them remember, that God is not more inclined to heare any prayers, then ſuch as parents doe powre forth for their children. As they are therefore to feare their curſe, for offending the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo muſt they by honouring and pleaſing them, ſeeke to bee bleſſed in their prayers, which are bleſſings ratified vnto them in heauen, as the bleſſing of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to his ſonne <hi>Jacob,</hi> doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declare.

For like as the Centurion,<note place="margin">Luke 7.8.</note> who had many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vnder his authoritie, and they were all at his becke and Commaundement, moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to obey him, in any thing that hee ſet them about, and this good order and ſubmiſſion hee had brought them vnto, by the reaſon that his ſaid ſeruants were deare vnto him: that is, hee
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:8506:188"/> made a ſpeciall reckoning of them, and was as a father vnto them: ſo likewiſe all maſters are in conſcience bound to eſteeme and account well of their ſeruants, and to vſe their authoritie that they haue ouer them, mildly and chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and then if their ſeruants doe perceiue that they are deare vnto their maſters,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.9.</note> ſo may the maſters in time worke them like waxe to their owne minde: except they be ſuch as haue ſold themſelues to worke wickedneſſe. It is very conuenient that a maſter of a familie ſhould ſo diſpoſe and order his affaires and buſines, that he depart &amp; abſent himſelfe from home, as little us may bee: for it is an olde ſaying and a true, That the eye of the maſter doth make the horſe fat, and the ground fertile: for al things are wel and fitly done when the maſter is preſent. Such houſe-keepers as haue much, and yet ſpend little, are called niggards: and they that haue little, and yet ſpend much, are holden fooles, ſpend-thrifts, and prodigall waſters: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to liue in ſuch ſort, that they be not noted mizers for their keeping, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall for their ſpending. The couetous miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable niggard paſſeth great toyle and trauels in gathering of his riches: danger in keeping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: law in defending them: and torment in depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from them. But a wiſe man is not carefull ſo much for riches, and how to liue long; as to liue well, and die well. Some houſeholders are ſo pinching and ſparing, both towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:8506:189"/> and their neighbours, that although they haue much wealth, yet they cannot find in their hearts to take part in any frugal and good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe tranſitorie bleſſings, which God in mercie hath giuen them: but feed groſly and very niggardly, and clothe themſelues very meanly: keeping a beggerly houſe, ſo that (as the common prouerbe is) a man may as ſoone breake his necke, as his faſt. So that the ſtate of ſuch a worldling and couetous rich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is moſt miſerable, to whom God hath bountifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed great wealth vpon, and yet hath not the grace to vſe his riches well, both to his owne comfort, and alſo to the good of his neighbour: but heapeth vp riches (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith) and cannot tell who ſhall gather them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.6.</note> This ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it is the plague of God that befalleth vpon ſuch a miſerable couetous worldling, when he hath plentie of al things,<note place="margin">The couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in gaining riches, loſeth himſelfe.</note> and yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a liberall heart to imploy and vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And therefore the holy Ghoſt, in the book of the Preacher, is not content once or twiſe to finde fault, and to checke this as a great vanitie and abuſe, but ſpeaketh of it fiue ſundrie times: where in one place he there ſaith: <hi>There is an euill which I ſaw vnder the ſunne, and it is much among men: A man to whom God hath giuen ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and treaſure, and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his ſoule of all that it deſireth: but God giueth him no power to eate thereof: but a ſtrange man ſhall eate it vp: this is vanitie, and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:8506:189"/> this is an euill ſicknes.</hi> Eccl. 2.24. and 3.12.13.22. and 5.17. and 6.1.2. and 8.15.</p>
               <p>Such maſters and miſtreſſes as would haue their neceſſarie affaires &amp; buſineſſes diſpatched well, and in due time,<note place="margin">That which thou canſt doe conueniently thy ſelfe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it not to another.</note> may not alwaies truſt to the doing thereof by their ſeruants: but they muſt either ſee it done, or rather diſpatch it themſelues, if it be ſuch a thing and buſineſſe as they can and may well do. For ſuch a lowlines is alwaies ioyned with the feare of God, that they that are humbled with religion, (though honourable and worſhipfull in calling) do not think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues too good to do any good thing.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This vndoubtedly is a thing greatly to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for: namely,<note place="margin">Maſters ought to make good choiſe of their ſeruants.</note> that all chriſtian maſters and houſeholders, (when they go about to hire any ſeruants) that then they would be no leſſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and inquiſitiue of their honeſtie, godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and how they haue profited in the knowledge of God his religion, as they bee to inquire and know what they can do, and what skill and cunning they haue in that Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they profeſſe, or els what qualities they haue: and ſo doing, no doubt (they being carefull to hire religious and godly ſeruants) their worke and buſineſſes, that ſuch ſeruants ſhall take in hand, the Lord will much better proſper, &amp; giue good ſucceſſe vnto, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if they ſhall hire and entertaine irreligious and prophane ſeruants: as may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> two

It is a rare thing for a maſter to bring his ſeruant to be godly, who is not godly himſelfe.</note> whoſe maſters and their ſubſtance was bleſſed, increaſed, and multiplied for their ſakes. As houſeholders ought to haue care ouer the bodies of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: ſo much more ouer their ſoules. One compareth the maſter of the houſe to the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin, which came and kindled the Prophets zeale: ſo he ſhould goe from wife to ſeruants, and from ſeruants to children, and kindle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the zeale of God, longing to teach and vtter his knowledge, as a Nurſe to emptie her breaſts.</p>
               <p>It is lamentable to think, how that al maſters, for the moſt part, not only ſuch as are prophane and ignorant themſelues: but alſo ſome that would bee counted great profeſſors, and would ſeeme to haue great knowledge: yea (and with griefe may it bee ſpoken) ſome preachers alſo that haue had ſeruants dwelling with them 3. or 4. yeares, or moe, who as they were ignorant in the grounds &amp; principles of Chriſtian religion, when they came firſt into their ſeruice, ſo they went from them as ignorant therein, as they came: and all for want of catechiſing, being a principall dutie, which not only Miniſters, but alſo al chriſtian maſters in conſcience are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to performe to their families. But of this matter I haue ſufficiently intreated of in my laſt editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Vſe and neceſſitie of catechiſing:</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will of purpoſe here omit to ſpeake of it.</p>
               <p>Another ſaith, that a maſter in his familie hath all the offices of Chriſt: for hee muſt rule, and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:8506:190"/> teach, and pray: rule like a King,<note place="margin">Reuel. 5.10. Act. 16.31.33. and 18.8. 1. Cor. 1.16. Luke. 22.32.</note> and teach like a Prophet, and pray like a Prieſt. To ſhew how a godly man ſhould behaue himſelfe in his houſehold: when the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh of the conuerſion of any houſe-keeper, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſaith: <hi>That the man beleeued, with all his houſehold.</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi> being conuerted, muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert his brethren: ſo the maſter being a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and a good chriſtian, muſt indeuour by al good meanes, that his ſeruants may be ſuch. For therefore God ſaid, that he would not hide his counſell from <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe hee would teach his familie. And ſurely al dutie of ſeruants,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.17.19.</note> which is not done of conſcience, is but eye ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and faileth at moſt need: as <hi>Ziba</hi> betrayed his maſter, when he ſhould haue defended him.<note place="margin">2.

Therefore it is noted of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> that he himſelfe feared God, with all his houſehold. This is reported alſo of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> for an example, that they went vp euery yeare, with all their families, to worſhip at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, that their children &amp; their ſeruants might learne to know God as well as they. Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples bee written for houſeholders, as others are for Magiſtrates &amp; Miniſters, and Souldiers, that no calling might ſeeke further then the Scriptures for inſtruction. Wherfore, as you are maſters now, and they your ſeruants, inſtruct them, and traine them, as if you would ſhew what maſters your ſeruants ſhuld be hereafter.</p>
               <p>Next vnto ſeruants labours and inſtruction, muſt bee conſidered their corrections. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Fathers, prouoke not your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wrath:</hi> ſo we may ſay, Maſters and Miſtreſſes, prouoke not your ſeruants to wrath: that is, vſe ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes, and ſuch corrections, that you doe not prouoke them, but moue them, that you do not exaſperate them, but win them: for reuiling &amp; reprochfull words, and immoderate fiercenes, doth much more hurt then good. And therfore the law of God did charge the maſter, that hee ſhould not inflict aboue fortie ſtripes vpon his ſeruant,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.2.3.</note> leaſt hee ſhould ſeeme deſpiſed in his eyes. For while a childe, or ſcholler, or ſeruant,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:8506:191"/> doth thinke that he is reproued for loue, or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with reaſon, it makes him think of his fault, and is aſhamed: but when hee ſeeth that he is rebuked with curſes, and beaten with ſtaues, as though he were hated like a dogge, his heart is hardned againſt the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which correcteth him, and the fault for the which he is corrected, and after hee becommeth deſperate, like a horſe which turneth vpon the ſtriker: and therefore let maſters know, that God euen then chides them, whenſoeuer they fight or chide in ſuch rage. For though there bee a fault, yet ſome things muſt be diſſembled and winked at: and ſome things muſt bee forgiuen, and ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a looke: for he which takes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of euery offence, ſhall neuer be in any reſt, but vexe himſelfe more then his ſeruant.</p>
               <p>But aboue all, we thinke the charitie and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection of maſters,<note place="margin">Maſters ought to haue a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care of their ſeruants in their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> and loue of ſeruants to their fellowes in their ſickneſſe, is eſpecially to be vſed and ſhewed: at which time the ſick are to bee ſeuerally lodged from the whole, and to be cheriſhed and nouriſhed with more choiſe and daintie meate. For the performance &amp; care of this dutie,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.5.6. Luk. 7.1.</note> the Centurion is commended in the Goſpell, which dutie very vnchriſtianly is neglected of many maſters. The maſter of the houſe ſhould not diſdaine, or ſhew himſelfe ſo ſcornfull or vnkinde, as not to viſit his ſicke ſeruant: for if brute beaſts reioyce to ſee their maſters cheriſh &amp; feed them, as we may daily
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:8506:192"/> ſee in dogs: how much more may we beleeue, that men &amp; reaſonable creatures are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and comforted therewith? Whereupon it comes to paſſe, that good and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, liking and affecting of their maſters, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them at a becke, and obey them at a winke of the eye, or bent of the brow, not as a water-ſpaniell, but as the hand is ſturred to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the mind, ſo prompt and readie is the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruant to obey his louing and kind maſter. For as the hand is ſaid to bee the inſtrument of inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, being it (indeed) that ſerues to feed, apparell, and keep cleane the reſt of the limmes, and parts of the body, which are alſo called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: ſo is the ſeruant ſaid to be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of inſtruments, becauſe he keepeth all the inſtruments of houſehold occupied, not only to liue, but to liue well, wherein he differeth from all the other inſtruments. For where they are things without ſoule, hee is diuinely enriched with a ſoule, and herein differeth from the hand, for that the hand is faſtned &amp; vnited to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but hee is ſeparate and diſioyned from his maſter, and is alſo different from Artificers: for Artificers are inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of thoſe things which properly they call workmanſhip: but the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is inſtrument of the action, which alſo is diſtinguiſhed from workmanſhip.

               <p>And as it is not comely or beſeeming,<note place="margin">The maſter muſt correct his men, and the miſtreſſe her maides.</note> that the wife ſhould take vpon her to rule &amp; correct the men-ſeruants: ſo likewiſe it is not comelie or meet that the husband ſhould meddle with the puniſhing or chaſtiſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maid-ſeruants: ſo that it is moſt meete and acceptable to the offender, that the maſter ſhould correct the men, and the miſtreſſe her maides: for a mans nature ſcorneth and diſdaineth to be be beaten of a woman: and a maides nature is corrupted with the ſtripes of a man. Therefore we reade, that <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And theſe are the duties which maſters muſt performe in their life time. All which muſt be ſhut vp, with ſetting order for all things at their death, with eſpeciall exhortations and prayers for religion, for vprightneſſe in their callings, for peace and order after them, according to the example of <hi>Hezechiah, Dauid,</hi> and of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and of <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> Eſay. 38.1. 1. King. 2.12. and Gen. 47.29.30.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:8506:193"/> and 49.29. So that it is the dutie of Chriſtian maſters to haue a care, not onely that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies bee well and chriſtianly gouerned while they liue: but alſo that after their death, loue, peace, quietnes, and good order may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their poſteritie.</p>
